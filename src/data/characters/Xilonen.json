In this state, she will shift to the Blade Roller mode.\n\n**Source Samples**\nXilonen has 3 Samplers with her that can generate different Soundscapes based on her other party members' Elemental Types, decreasing nearby opponents' corresponding Elemental RES while active.\nThe initial recorded Source Sample within each Sampler will be **Geo**, and for each party member who is **Pyro**/**Hydro**/**Cryo**/**Electro**, 1 **Geo** Sample will change to that corresponding Element.\nWhile Xilonen is in the Nightsoul's Blessing state, the **Geo** Source Sample she carries will always be active.

After this limit passes, her Nightsoul points will immediately expire.\n\nAfter Xilonen's Nightsoul points have expired while she is in the Nightsoul's Blessing state, she will no longer be able to generate Nightsoul points via the Passive Talent \"Netotiliztli's Echoes.\"\n\n**In some ways, gem-craft and music-mixing share similar principles: Filtering out impurities and retaining only the most radiant things.\nXilonen isn't picky about the two, however.
