{% tab title="Chihayaburu" %}

Unleashes a secret technique as fierce as the rushing wind that pulls objects and opponents towards Kazuha's current position before launching opponents within the AoE, dealing Anemo DMG and lifting Kazuha into the air on a rushing gust of wind. Within 10s of remaining airborne after casting **Chihayaburu**, Kazuha can unleash a powerful Plunging Attack known as **Midare Ranzan**. 

* **Press:** Can be used in mid-air.

* **Hold:** Charges up before unleashing greater Anemo DMG over a larger AoE than Press Mode. 
  * Kazuha's Hold **Chihayaburu** can cause certain enemies to take Fall DMG.

**Plunging Attack: Midare Ranzan**

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Kazuha Slash" %}
The signature technique of Kazuha's self-styled bladework — a single slash that strikes with the force of the first winds of autumn, dealing AoE Anemo DMG. The blade's passage will leave behind a field named "**Autumn Whirlwind**" that periodically deals AoE Anemo DMG to opponents within its range. 

**Elemental Absorption**  
If **Autumn Whirlwind** comes into contact with Hydro/Pyro/Cryo/Electro, it will deal additional elemental DMG of that type. Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use.

## **Ascension Passives**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Passive" %}
### Cloud Strider

Decreases sprinting Stamina consumption for your own party members by 20%. Not stackable with Passive Talents that provide the exact same effects.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 1" %}
### Soumon Swordsmanship

If **Chihayaburu** comes into contact with Hydro/Pyro/Cryo/Electro when cast, **Chihayaburu** will absorb that element and if **Plunging Attack: Midare Ranzan** is used before the effect expires, it will deal an additional 200% ATK of the absorbed elemental type as DMG. This will be considered Plunging Attack DMG. Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use of Chihayaburu.

| Type | Soumon Swordsmanship |
| :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG | 200% |
| GU | 1A |
| Damage Element | Infused Element |
| Damage Type | Plunge |

* The elemental damage is applied before Midare Ranzan, allowing it to swirl without a pre-existing aura on enemies, additionally this also means that the applied aura can react with pre-existing aura, potentially resulting in no swirl. 
* Infusion priority: Pyro > Hydro > Electro > Cryo   
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 4" %}
### Poetics of Fuubutsu

Upon triggering a Swirl reaction, Kaedehara Kazuha will grant teammates a 0.04% Elemental DMG Bonus to their corresponding Element for every point of Elemental Mastery he has for 8s. Bonuses for different elements obtained through this method can co-exist.
* Kazuha's 4th ascension passive works off-field and only gives bonus damage on swirled elements.
* Kazuha's 4th ascension passive overrides previous instances on every swirl.
{% endtab %}
