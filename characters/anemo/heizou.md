| String | Talent 9% | Frames | MV/s | Poise Damage | Impulse Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| N1C | 124.1% | - | - | 120 | 5 |
| Recovery | - | - | - | - | - |

**Notes:**  
* It is possible to dragon strike with N1C.
* When swapping out of CA, it's slightly faster to N1 cancel into a swap than doing it normally.
 
**Plunge**  
Calling upon the surging wind, Heizou plunges towards the ground from mid-air, damaging all opponents in his path. Deals AoE Anemo DMG upon impact with the ground.
 
| Damage Type | Talent 9% |

{% tab title="Heartstopper Strike" %}

**Tap**  
Wields the swift winds to launch a Heartstopper Strike that deals Anemo DMG.

**Hold**  
Charges energy to unleash an even stronger blow. He will obtain the Declension effect while charging, which will increase the power of the Heartstopper Strike. When the skill button is released or the skill finishes charging, he will strike forward, dealing Anemo DMG.

**Declension**  
Increases the power of the next Heartstopper Strike. Max 4 stacks.
When you possess 4 Declension stacks, the Conviction effect will be produced, which will cause the next Hearstopper Strike to be even stronger and have a larger AoE.

{% endtab %}
 
{% tab title="Windmuster Kick" %}

Leaps into the air and uses the Fudou Style Vacuum Slugger and kicks his opponent. The Vacuum Slugger will explode upon hit and create an Arresting Windtunnel that pulls in nearby objects and opponents, dealing AoE Anemo DMG.  
When Vacuum Slugger hits opponents affected by Hydro/Pyro/Cryo/Electro, these opponents will be afflicted with Windmuster Iris. This Windmuster Iris will explode after a moment and dissipate, dealing AoE DMG of the corresponding aforementioned elemental type.  
Vacuum Slugger can afflict a maximum of 4 opponents with the Windmuster Iris. A single opponent cannot be under the effect of Windmuster Irises of different elements at the same time.

Not stackable with Passive Talents that provide the exact same effects.
 
{% endtab %}
 
{% tab title="Ascension 1" %}
### **Paradoxical Practice**

When Shikanoin Heizou activates a Swirl reaction while on the field, he will gain 1 Declension stack for Heartstopper Strike. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s.

**Notes:**  
* Swirling objects doesn't give Heizou any **Declension** stacks.

{% endtab %}
 
{% tab title="Ascension 4" %}

## **Constellations**
 
{% tabs %}
{% tab title="C1" %}

{% endtab %}
 
{% tab title="C5" %}
### **Secret Archive**
