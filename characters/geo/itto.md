{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Fight Club Legend" %}
**Normal Attacks**  
Perform up to 4 consecutive strikes.  
• When the 2nd and 4th strikes hit opponents, Itto will gain 1 or 2 stacks of **Superlative Superstrength**, respectively. Max 5 stacks. Triggering this effect will refresh the current duration of any existing stacks.  
• Additionally, Itto's Normal Attack combo does not immediately reset after sprinting or using his Elemental Skill, "**Masatsu Zetsugi: Akaushi Burst!**"

| String | Talent 9% | Frames | MV/s |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-Hit | 145.57% | 23 | 379.75%/s |
| 2-Hit | 140.3% | 67 | 256%/s |
| 3-Hit | 168.36% | 101 | 269.84%/s |
| 4-Hit | 215.37% | 181 | 221.97%/s |
| Recovery | 669.6% | 202 | 198.89%/s |

**Notes**
* Itto can gain **Superlative Superstrength** stacks while off field.
* Itto's **Superlative Superstrength** stacks persist through character swap.

**Charged Attack**  
When holding to perform a Charged Attack, Itto unleashes a series of **Arataki Kesagiri** slashes without consuming Stamina. Instead, each **Arataki Kesagiri** slash consumes 1 stack of **Superlative Superstrength**. When the final stack is consumed, Itto delivers a powerful final slash.
If no stacks of **Superlative Superstrength** are available, Itto will perform a single **Saichimonji Slash**.

| String | Talent 9% | Frames | MV/s |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Arataki Kesagiri Combo Slash DMG | 167.48% | - | - |
| Arataki Kesagiri Final Slash DMG | 350.76% | - | - |
| Saichimonji Slash DMG | 131.5% | - | - |
| 5CA | 807.5% | 180 | 340.23%/s |
| 5CA w/ Recovery | ~ | 207 | 295.85%/s |
| SCAF | 350.76% | 74 | 284.4%/s |
| SCAF w/ Recovery | ~ | 102 | 206.33%/s |

**Notes**
* **Arataki Kesagiri Combo Slash** and **Final Slash**'s hitbox can hit enemies located behind Itto.

**Plunge**  
 Plunges from mid-air to strike the ground, damaging opponents along the path and dealing AoE DMG upon impact.

| Damage Type | Talent 9% |
| :--- | :--- |
| Plunge Impact | 150.35% |
| Low Plunge DMG | 300.63% |
| High Plunge DMG | 375.5% |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Masatsu Zetsugi: Akaushi Burst!" %}
**Press**  
Hurls Ushi, the young akaushi bull and auxiliary member of the Arataki Gang, dealing Geo DMG to opponents on hit. When Ushi hits opponents, Arataki Itto gains 1 stack of **Superlative Superstrength**.  

Ushi will remain on the field and provide support in the following ways:  
• Taunts surrounding opponents and draws their attacks.  
• Inherits HP based on a percentage of Arataki Itto's Max HP.  
• When Ushi takes DMG, Arataki Itto gains 1 stack of **Superlative Superstrength**. Only 1 stack can be gained in this way every 2s.  
• Ushi will flee when its HP reaches 0 or its duration ends. It will grant Arataki Itto 1 stack of **Superlative Superstrength** when it leaves.  

**Hold**  
Adjust throwing angle.  
Ushi is considered a Geo construct. Arataki Itto can only deploy 1 Ushi on the field at any one time.

| Attribute | Ushi | 
| :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG \(T9%\) | 522.24% |
| Inherited HP | 100% |
| Particles | 3~4 \(1:1\) | 
| Frames | 26 |
| GU | 1U |
| ICD | - | 
| Snapshot | - | 
| Damage Element | Geo | 
| Damage Type | Skill |
| Duration | 6s |
| CD | 10s | 

**Notes**
* Ushi counts towards the Geo construct limit.
* Ushi's duration starts at land, not on cast.
* Hold E has a maximum 10s timer.
* Ushi still persists and gains stacks after teleporting.
* Ushi is unsuckable (via Sucrose and Kazuha).
* Ushi can be pushed by either Itto or enemies.

{% tab title="Royal Descent: Behold, Itto the Evil!" %}
Time to show 'em the might of the Arataki Gang! For a time, Itto lets out his inner Raging Oni King, wielding his Oni King's Kanabou in battle.

This state has the following special properties:  
• Converts Itto's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks to Geo DMG. This cannot be overridden.  
• Increases Itto's Normal Attack SPD. Also increases his ATK based on his DEF.  
• On hit, the 1st and 3rd strikes of his attack combo will each grant Arataki Itto 1 stack of **Superlative Superstrength**.  
• Decreases Itto's Elemental and Physical RES by 20%.  
The Raging Oni King state will be cleared when Itto leaves the field.

| Attribute | Burst |
| :--- | :--- |
| ATK Bonus \(T9%\) | 97.92% DEF |
| ATK SPD Bonus | 10% |
| Energy Cost | 70 |
| Duration | 11s |
| CD | 18s |

**Notes**
* **Royal Descent: Behold, Itto the Evil!** snapshots DEF but does not shapshot Geo DMG or ATK.
  * Right after Gorou uses his Elemental Burst, if Itto is swapped in either with Alt + Num or manually he will consistently snapshot the buffs. This only happens when the ping is below 75ms, otherwise it's inconsistent, with a 53% success rate at 200\~350ms.
* Itto's converted attacks apply 1U Geo. 
  * Itto's converted Normal and Charged Attacks have standard 3 hit / 2.5s ICD.
* **Royal Descent: Behold, Itto the Evil!**'s duration can be extended through hitlag.
* **Royal Descent: Behold, Itto the Evil!** can expire in the middle of a CA string.
* Burst duration can significantly extend past its normal duration by doing an attack at the end of burst. This extension ends immediately on any action after the final attack.
* Using **Royal Descent: Behold, Itto the Evil!** during N1 hitlag also gives **Superlative Strength** stacks
