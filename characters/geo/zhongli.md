{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Dominus Lapidis" %}Every mountain, rock and inch of land is filled with the power of Geo, but those who can wield such powers freely are few and far between.

**Press**  
Commands the power of earth to create a **Stone Stele**.

**Hold**  
Causes nearby Geo energy to explode, causing the following effects:  
• If their maximum number hasn't been reached, creates a **Stone Stele**.  
• Creates a shield of jade. The shield's DMG Absorption scales based on Zhongli's Max HP.  
• Deals AoE Geo DMG.  
• If there are nearby targets with the Geo element, it will drain a large amount of Geo element from a maximum of 2 such targets. This effect does not cause DMG.

**Stone Stele**

When created, **Stone Stele** deals AoE Geo damage.  
Additionally, it will intermittently resonate with other nearby Geo constructs, dealing Geo damage to nearby opponents.  
The Stone Stele is considered a Geo construct that can both be climbed and used to block attacks.  
Only one Stele created by Zhongli himself may initially exist at any one time.

**Jade Shield**

Possesses 150% damage absorption against all Elemental and Physical damage.  
Characters protected by the **Jade Shield** will decrease the Elemental Resistance and Physical Resistance of nearby enemies within a radius by 20%. This effect can not be stacked with other instances of **Jade Shield**.

**Notes**
* Hits that resonate from other Geo constructs still proc the 4-piece Tenacity of the Millileth set.
* **Stone Steles** are considered a Geo construct that can be used to block attacks, or climb. 
* Resonation can overlap to deal multiple instances of damage.
* Steles resonate independently and do not resonate with each other.
