{% tab title="Starfell Sword" %}
Summons a meteorite that deals Geo damage and launches small enemies

* The meteorite is considered a Geo construct and can be climbed or use to block attacks
* Holding allows you to aim where the meteorite appears and has a faster animation time.
* There is a construct limit of 3 Geo constructs max on one field, after hitting the maximum the oldest construct will be destroyed whenever a new construct is created.

| Type | Talent 6% |
| :--- | :--- |
| Base DMG | 347.2% |
| Duration | 30s |
| Cooldown | 8s |
| GU | 1U |

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Wake of Earth" %}
Deals 5 waves of damage to enemies and knocks them back away from the caster.

* Creates 4 walls one in each cardinal direction from where the character is facing. 
* These are considered Geo constructs but do not count towards the construct limit and cannot be climbed.

| Effect | Talent 6% / Data |
| :--- | :--- |
| Elemental burst DMG | 207.2% |
| Duration | 15s |
| Cooldown | 15s \(non-scaling\) |
