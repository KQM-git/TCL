{% tab title="Violet Arc" %}
Channels the power of lightning to sweep bothersome matters away.

**Press**  
Releases a homing **Lightning Orb**.

* On hit, it deals Electro DMG, and applies a stack of the **Conductive** status \(Max 3 stacks\) to opponents in a small AoE.

**Hold**  
After an extended casting time, calls down lightning from the heavens, dealing massive Electro DMG to all nearby opponents.

* Deals extra damage to opponents based on the number of **Conductive** stacks applied to them.
* Clears **Conductive** status on hit.

| Effect | Talent 6% | Frames | MV/s |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Press DMG | 112% | 21 | 320%/s |
| Press CD | 1s | 81 | 83%/s |
| Hold DMG | 448% | 116 | 231.7%/s |
| Stack 1 DMG | 515.2% | 116 | 264.9%/s |
| Stack 2 DMG | 593.6% | 116 | 307%/s |
| Stack 3 DMG | 682.06% | 116 | 352.8%/s |
| Holding CD | 16s | ~ | ~ |
| Press GU | 1A | ~ | ~ |
| Hold GU | 2B | ~ | ~ |
| Hold Particles | 5 \(-\) | ~ | ~ |

* The **Lightning Orb** bounces to nearby targets with the small AoE spreading **Conductive** stacks each bounce
  * This means in tight enough groups, it can apply all 3 stacks in a single Press E
* The hitbox of Lisa's Hold E is a cylinder with the following dimensions/attributes:
  * Its Radius is indicated by its VFX and mobs' centers have to be inside said radius in order to take damage.
  * Its Height/Depth is either unlimited or absurdly large. This is difficult to properly quantize.
  * Its hitbox can clip through the terrain, allowing it to connect with enemies that are out of Lisa's direct Line of Sight.
* Lisa can Utilize Pyro/Cryo with her Press E variant of **Violet Arc** to Stack **Conductive** Stacks
  * When an opponent affected by Pyro or Cryo is struck, the mob directly hit will immediately gain 2 **Conductive** Stacks, and others in the resulting Overload or Superconduct radius will gain 1 **Conductive** Stack
  * If Violet Arc connects and causes Overload or Superconduct while in a Pyro or Cryo-environment \(the most common ones being Burning Grass and Frozen Water\), the direct hit mob will obtain 3 **Conductive** stacks and will radiate 2 stacks to nearby opponents. 
  * If 2 opponents are nearby and only one is afflicted with a status, if the afflicted mob is hit, both enemies will gain 3 stacks of **Conductive**

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Lightning Rose" %}
Summons a **Lightning Rose** that unleashes powerful lightning bolts, launching surrounding opponents and dealing Electro DMG.

| Discharge DMG | 51.18% | 30 | 102.4%/s |
| Duration | 15s | ~ | ~ |
| CD | 20s | ~ | ~ |
| Energy Cost | 80 | ~ | ~ |
| GU | 1A | ~ | ~ |
