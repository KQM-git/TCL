## **Attacks**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Oceanborne" %}
**Normal Attacks**  
Beidou performs up to 5 consecutive attacks.

| String | Talent 9% | Frames | MV/s |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-Hit | 130.67% | 23 | 340.88%/s |
| 2-Hit | 130.19% | 66 | 237.15%/s |
| 3-Hit | 162.27% | 134 | 189.46%/s |
| 4-Hit | 158.95% | 178 | 196.21%/s |
| 5-Hit | 206.03% | 246 | 192.22%/s |

**Notes**  
Normal attacks without **Lightning Storm** \(A4 passive\) active lose about 30% damage output.

* C0-C3 Beidou's should use N4 cancels or N5 dash cancels.
* Beidou's normal attack string concludes with a kick to the sword with her foot. Whether her model makes contact with the claymore depends on the model size of the claymore. We can conclude that it is intended to be a kick to the claymore because a sound will play no matter what model size the claymore.

**Charged Attack**  
Beidou consumes 40 stamina a second to perform continuous slashes.  
At the end of the 5 seconds, perform a more powerful slash.

| String | Talent 9% | Frames | MV/s |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Slash | 103.33% | 35 | 177.14%/s |
| Final Slash | 187.07% | 32 | 350.76/s |

**Notes**
* Charged Attack wind up is 71 frames long.
* All frame counts are done against a Ruin Guard

**Plunge**  
Plunges from mid-air to strike the ground, damaging opponents along the path and dealing AoE DMG upon impact.

| Damage Type | Talent 9% |
| :--- | :--- |
| Plunge Impact | 137.03% |
| Low Plunge DMG | 274.01% |
| High Plunge DMG | 342.25% |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Tidecaller" %}
Nothing to worry about. Should anyone raise a hand against her or her men, she will avenge it ten-fold with sword and thunder.

**Press**  
Accumulating the power of lightning, Beidou swings her blade forward fiercely, dealing Electro DMG.

**Hold**  
Lifts her weapon up as a shield. Max DMG absorbed scales off Beidou's Max HP.  
Attacks using the energy stored within the greatsword upon release or once this ability's duration expires, dealing Electro DMG. DMG dealt scales with the number of times Beidou is attacked in the skill's duration. The greatest DMG Bonus will be attained once this effect is triggered twice.

The shield possesses the following properties:  
• Has 250% Electro DMG Absorption Efficiency.  
• Applies the Electro element to Beidou upon activation.

| Attribute | Tap | Hold |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Base DMG \(T9%\) | 206.72% | 206.72% |
| DMG Bonus on Hit Taken \(T9%\) | - | 272% \(scaling\) |
| Particles | 2 | 2 ~ 4 \(see note\) |
| Frames | 41 | - |
| GU | 2B | 2B |
| ICD | None | None |
| Snapshot | Dynamic | Dynamic |
| Damage Element | Electro | Electro |
| Damage Type | Skill | Skill |
| Duration | - | upto 3s |
| CD | 7.5s | 7.5s |

| Attribute | Shield \(Talent 9%\) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Scaling | 24.48% Max HP + 2819 |
| Elemental Type | Electro |
| Duration | Hold Duration |

**Notes**
* **Tidecaller** will produce minimum 2 particles, if you get hit once while holding \(one charge\) it produces 3 particles and if you get hit two times \(two charges\) or perform a **perfect parry** it will produce 4 particles.
* Beidou can perfect counter shots from the Inazuma Kamuijima Cannons.
* The counter has 0/1 startup frames, depending on whether your input is registered immediately or with a 1 frame delay. [Vault Entry](../../evidence/characters/electro/beidou.md#beidou-counter-startup)
* **Tidecaller** counter scaling information is tabulated in the table below.

| Tidecaller DMG Bonus | Talent 9%  | Particles | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- 
| 0 Stacks | 206.72% | 2 |
| 1 Stack | 478.72% | 3 |
| 2 Stacks / Perfect Parry  | 750.72% | 4 |

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Stormbreaker" %}
Recalling her slaying of the great beast Haishan, Beidou calls upon that monstrous strength and the lightning to create a **Thunderbeast's Targe** around herself, dealing Electro DMG to nearby opponents.

**Thunderbeast's Targe**  
• When Normal and Charged Attacks hit, they create a **lightning discharge** that can jump between opponents, dealing Electro DMG.  
•  Increases active character’s resistance to interruption and decreases DMG taken.  
A maximum of 1 **lightning discharge** can be triggered per second.

| Attribute | Burst | Lightning Discharge |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Burst DMG \(T9%\) | 206.72% | 163.2% |
| Lightning Bounces | - | 2 |
| DMG Reduction | 32% \(scaling\) | - |
| Frames | 45 | - |
| GU | 4C | 1A | 
| ICD | - | 3 hit / 2.5s |
| Snapshot | Snapshot | Snapshot | 
| Damage Element | Electro | Electro |
| Damage Type | Burst | Burst |
| Energy Cost | 80 | - |
| Duration | 15s | 15s |
| Cooldown | 20s | 1s |

**Notes**
* Beidou's **lightning discharges** have 3 damage instances with 2 targets or more.
* **Stormbreaker**'s additional arc lightning can jump back to the initial target.
* The counter for the cooldown does not start on when Beidou's lightning discharge hits, but when the normal attack hits. Hence, the discharge CD can be randomly and inconsistently affected by ping spikes and is not consistently 1 second. - [Vault Entry](../../evidence/characters/electro/beidou.md#beidou-lightning-proc-cd)
* **Lightning discharge** can bounce off Mitachurl Shields but will deal no damage.
* Snapshot on cast.
  * However, if you swap to Beidou and cast her Burst too quick (Left Alt + Switch Character), her Lightning DMG might fail to snapshot certain buffs.
* The **Lightning Discharge's** have a range limit, starting from the character attacking, that is calculated after the attack hits and is not affected by travel time.
* The attacker must be on field when the attack hits to proc a **Lightning Discharge.**
