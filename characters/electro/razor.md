Upon striking an opponent, Razor will gain an Electro Sigil, which increases his Energy Recharge rate.  
Razor can have up to 3 Electro Sigils simultaneously, and gaining a new Electro Sigil refreshes their duration.

**Hold**

Each Electro Sigil cleared in this manner will be converted into Energy for Razor.

* The duration of the sigils is 18s and is refreshed every time you press **Claw and Thunder**.
* **Claw and Thunder**'s animation is different and slightly slower during **Lightning Fang**.
* During **Claw and Thunder** (Hold), any active **Sigils** will be absorbed by Razor granting him 5 energy for each sigil.
  * This energy is not affected by ER.
* **Claw and Thunder** (Hold) causes a small self-knockback when used.
* The **Electro Sigils** are not immediately consumed when dashing after Hold E.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Lightning Fang" %}
Summons **the Wolf Within**, which deals Electro DMG to all nearby opponents. This clears all of Razor's Electro Sigils, which will be converted into Elemental Energy for him.  
**The Wolf Within** will fight alongside Razor for the skill's duration.

• Strikes alongside Razor's normal attacks, dealing Electro DMG.  
• Raises Razor's ATK SPD and Electro RES.  
• Causes Razor to be immune to DMG inflicted by the Electro-Charged status.  
• Disables Razor's Charged Attacks.  
• Increases Razor's resistance to interruption.  
These effects end when Razor leaves the battlefield.

When Razor leaves the field, a maximum of 10 Energy will be returned to him based off the duration remaining on this skill.

* The duration of **Lightning Fang** can be extended by hitlag
* Superconduct triggered by enemy Cryo attacks while Razor's **Lightning Fang** is active will affect nearby enemies as well as Razor.
* Bennett’s **Fantastic Voyage** self pyro application can react with Razor’s self electro application to proc overload on yourself.
