**Notes**

* **Tengu Juurai: Ambush** DMG is snapshot upon **Tengu Stormcall** cast.
* Sara does not lose the effects of **Crowfeather Cover** if swapped off.
* **Crowfeather** does not stick to walls; it sticks to the closest walkable surface from the point of collision.
* A fully-charged aimed shot fired with **Crowfeather Cover** will disappear after 2 seconds in flight.
* **Crowfeather** triggers **Tengu Juurai: Ambush** 1.5s after landing.
* **Crowfeather** has a "semi-taunt" mechanic, where it can draw enemy attention even while not in combat mode.
* The hitbox to gain an ATK buff from **Tengu Juurai: Ambush** is massive vertically.
* The damage hitbox of **Tengu Juurai: Ambush** is different from the hitbox to gain an ATK Buff.

* **Titanbreaker** targets closest enemy, then **Stormcluster** moves outward in a plus-shape with one branch directed at Sara’s location at time of cast.
