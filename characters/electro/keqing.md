description: The Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Keqing has much to say about Rex Lapis' unilateral approach to policymaking in Liyue — but in truth, gods admire skeptics such as her quite a lot.

## **Attacks**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Yunlai Swordsmanship" %}
**Normal Attacks**  
Keqing performs up to 5 consecutive attacks.

| String | Talent 9% | Frames | MV/s |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-Hit | 75.37% | 11 | 411.11%/s |
| 2-Hit | 75.37% | 33 | 274.08%/s |
| 3-Hit | 100.01% | 60 | 250.75%/s |
| 4-Hit | 57.83% + 63.2% | 87 / 97 | 229.97%/s |
| 5-Hit | 123.08% | 133 | 223.25%/s |

**Charged Attack**  
Keqing consumes 25 stamina to unleash 2 rapid strikes.

| :--- | :--- |
| Charged Attack | 141.09% + 158% |

| String | Frames | MV/s (Talent 9%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| N1C | 63 | 356.63%/s |
| N4C | 150 | 268.35%/s |

* Keqing's N1C is her highest damage combo but is stamina hungry.
  * N4C is a comparable damage combo that is less stamina intensive.

**Plunge**  
Plunges from mid-air to strike the ground below, damaging opponents along the path and dealing AoE DMG upon impact.

| Type | Talent 9% |
| :--- | :--- |
| Plunge DMG | 117.46% |
| Low Plunge DMG | 234.86% |
| High Plunge DMG | 293.36% |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Stellar Restoration" %}
**Press**  
Hurls a **Lightning Stiletto** that annihilates her opponents like the swift thunder.  
When the **Stiletto** hits its target, it deals Electro DMG to opponents in a small AoE, and places a **Stiletto Mark** on the spot hit.

**Hold**  
Hold to adjust the direction in which the **Stiletto** shall be thrown.  
**Stilettos** thrown by the Hold attack mode can be suspended in mid-air, allowing Keqing to jump to them when using Stellar Restoration a second time.

**Lightning Stiletto \(recast\)**  
If Keqing uses **Stellar Restoration** again or uses a **Charged Attack** while its duration lasts, it will clear the **Stiletto Mark** and produce different effects:  
• If she uses **Stellar Restoration** again, she will blink to the location of the Mark and unleash one slashing attack that deals AoE Electro DMG. When blinking to a Stiletto that was thrown from a Holding attack, Keqing can leap across obstructing terrain.  
• If Keqing uses a **Charged Attack**, she will ignite a series of thundering cuts at the Mark's location, dealing AoE Electro DMG.  

| Attribute | Lightning Stiletto | Thunderclap Slash |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Lightning Stiletto \(T9%\) | 85.68% | - |
| Stiletto Mark Secondary \(T9%\) | 285.6% | 142.8% x 2 |
| Particles | 2~3 \(1:1\) | - |
| Frames | 34 | - |
| Frames Secondary | 84 | 90 |

| ICD Secondary | 3 hit / 2.5s | - |
| Snapshot | Snapshot | - |
| Damage Element | Electro | - |
| Damage Type |  Skill | - |
| CD | 7.5s | - |

**Notes**
* When blinking to a **Stiletto Mark** that was thrown from a Holding cast, Keqing can move across obstructions and glide or initiate a plunge attack.
* Keqing's second **Stellar Restoration** cast is buffered during her dash.
* Keqing can gain 2 stacks of 4pc Pale Flame in one cast of **Stellar Restoration** by dropping a **Stilleto Mark** on a enemy and performing a charge attack.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Starward Sword" %}
Keqing unleashes the power of lightning, dealing Electro DMG in an AOE.  
She then blends into the shadow of her blade, striking a series of thunderclap-blows to nearby opponents simultaneously that deal multiple instances of Electro DMG. The final attack deals massive AoE Electro DMG.

| Attribute | Burst |
| :--- | :--- |
| Cast DMG \(T9%\) | 149.6% |
| Consecutive Slash DMG \(T9%\) | 40.8% x 8 |
| Last Attack \(T9%\) | 320.96% |
| Frames | 125 |
| GU | 1U |
| ICD | 3 hit / 2.5s |
| Snapshot | Dynamic |
| Damage Element | Electro |
| Damage Type | Burst |
| Energy Cost | 40 |

## **Ascension Passives**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Passive" %}
### **Land's Overseer**

When dispatched on an expedition in Liyue, time consumed is reduced by 25%.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 1" %}
### **Thundering Penance**

After recasting **Stellar Restoration** while a **Lightning Stiletto** is present, Keqing's weapon gains an **Electro Infusion** for 5s.

| Type | GU |
| :--- | :--- |
| Electro Infusion | 1A |

* Keqing's **Electro Infusion** can be overwritten other infusion effects \(Chongyun **Chonghua Field** and Bennett **Inspiration Field** C6\).

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 4" %}
### **Aristocratic Dignity**

When casting **Starward Sword**, Keqing's CRIT Rate is increased by 15%, and her Energy Recharge is increased by 15%. This effect lasts for 8s.

  * The timer for the duration of these buffs also begins on **Starward Sword** cast.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## **Constellations**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="C1" %}
### **Thundering Might**

Recasting **Stellar Restoration** while a **Lightning Stiletto** is present causes Keqing to deal 50% of her ATK as **AoE Electro DMG** at the start point and terminus of her Blink.

* An enemy can be hit twice by the **Thundering Might** AoE if **Stellar Restoration** is recast at point blank range. However, it can be inconsistent on smaller enemies since the AoE is small.
* C1 damage instance has no ability type scaling tags.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C2" %}
### **Keen Extraction**

When Keqing's Normal and Charged Attacks hit opponents affected by **Electro**, they have a 50% chance of producing an Elemental Particle.  
This effect can only occur once every 5s.

* The proc rate of **Keen Extraction** is inconsistent, and does not work as stated.  
  * For more details, see the [full entry](../../evidence/characters/electro/keqing.md#keqing-c2-procs-inconsistently) in Keqing's Evidence Vault.
