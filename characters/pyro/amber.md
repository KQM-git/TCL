| ICD | None |
| Snapshot | Snapshots |
| Damage Element | Pyro |
| Damage Type | Skill | 
| Duration | 8s |
| Cooldown | 15s |

* The explosion has the blunt attribute that lets it damage shields and shatter frozen enemies like claymores.
* **Baron Bunny** can be picked up by Anemo units like Jean and Sucrose when they use their elemental skills.
* The explosion radius is smaller than the animation so take care when aiming it.
* A percentage of Amber's HP is used to determine how much damage **Baron Bunny** can take before exploding.
* Baron Bunny is allowed to have a hydro or cryo aura, as well as be frozen. 
  * Only environmental effects may apply the hydro aura. 
  * Most reactions function properly on this aura, notably: crystalize, swirl, superconduct, and shatter.
* Multiple Baron Bunnies can be spawned without C4 when utilizing cooldown reduction effects.

* Does 18 waves total over 2 seconds in the center of the Aoe.
* 8 of the waves cover approximately the outer half the size of the marker.
* 10 waves cover the inner half of the marker. 
* Anything in the outer half is expected to get hit a random number of times, with closer to the edge being lower in the number of hits.
* The random arrow distribution in Amber's burst makes the reaction potential of her burst as the trigger very inconsistent. 
* Applies 1A worth of pyro 6 times, following normal ICD rules.
