{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Guhua Sword: Fatal Rainscreen" %}
Xingqiu performs two strikes with his sword, dealing Hydro DMG. At the same time, this ability creates the maximum number of **Rain Swords**, which will orbit your active character.

The Rain Swords have the following properties:  
• When a character takes DMG, the Rain Sword will shatter, reducing the amount of DMG taken.  
• Increases the character's resistance to interruption.

20% of Xingqiu's Hydro DMG Bonus will be converted to additional DMG Reduction for the Rain Swords.  
The maximum amount of additional DMG Reduction that can be gained this way is 24%.  
The initial maximum number of Rain Swords is 3.

Using this ability applies the Wet status onto the character.

| Attribute | Skill |
| :--- | :--- |
| Skill DMG (T9%) | 285.6% + 325.04% |
| Particles | 5 \(-\) |
| Frames | 82 |
| GU | 1A \(x2\) |
| ICD | None |
| Damage Element | Hydro |
| Damage Type | Skill |

| DMG Reduction (T9%) | 20% Hydro DMG + 28% |
| Snapshot | Snapshot |
| GU | 1A |
| ICD | 2.25s |
| Duration | 15s |

**Notes** 
* The DMG Reduction does not take the Hydro DMG% bonus gained from Kazuha's A4 into account.
* Increased resistance to interruption stacks with other skills of similar effects.
* After the **Rain Swords** pop, there is a small window of time where Xingqiu can apply hydro to enemies, even if the rain swords aren't visible
  * This occurs with the orbitals created by both Xingqiu's Skill and Burst
* Only one **Rain Sword** can be shattered at a time, and the shattering has a cooldown of 1.5s. 
* While casting **Guhua Sword: Fatal Rainscreen**, Xingqiu can start dashing on frame 36 and start casting **Guhua Sword: Raincutter** on frame 58.
* Using **Guhua Sword: Fatal Rainscreen** applies a very brief 1U Hydro aura onto the character.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Guhua Sword: Raincutter" %}
Initiate **Rainbow Bladework** and fight using an illusory sword rain, while creating the maximum number of Rain Swords.

**Rainbow Bladework**  
• Your active character's Normal Attacks will trigger consecutive sword rain attacks, dealing Hydro DMG.  
• Rain Swords will remain at the maximum number throughout the ability's duration.

| Attribute | Burst |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sword Rain DMG (T9%) | 92.26% |
| Frames | 29 |
| GU | 1A |
| ICD | 3 hit / 2.5s |
| Snapshot | Dynamic |
| Damage Element | Hydro |
| Damage Type | Burst |
| Energy Cost | 80 |
| Duration | 15s |
| CD | 20s |

**Notes**
* The number of **Sword Rain** attacks in each wave cycles in a 2-3 sequence, with the first wave having 2 Sword Rain attacks.
* **Rain Swords** will not shatter.
* **Rain Swords** DMG Reduction created by **Guhua Sword: Raincutter** also snapshots.
  * Before swapping, **Guhua Sword: Raincutter**'s Rain Swords will always override **Guhua Sword: Fatal Rainscreen**'s .
  * After swapping, the DMG Reduction is based on the most recently cast Rain Swords.
* **Sword Rain** waves can be triggered at most once a second. However, so long as you are in an normal attack animation, even if you attack slightly before 1 second has passed, the next **Sword Rain** wave will be triggered as soon as possible.
* The Normal Attack may be cancelled, but **Sword Rain** wave will still be triggered.
