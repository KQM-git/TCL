This ability cannot be used to travel behind opponents of a larger build.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Rites of Termination" %}
Rosaria's unique take on this prayer ritual: First, she swings her weapon to slash surrounding opponents; then, she summons a frigid **Ice Lance** that strikes the ground. Both actions deal Cryo DMG.  
While active, the **Ice Lance** periodically releases a blast of cold air, dealing **Cryo** DMG to surrounding opponents.

## **Ascension Passives**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Passive" %}
### **Night Walk**

At night (18:00–6:00), increases the Movement SPD of your own party members by 10%.
Does not take effect in Domains, Trounce Domains, or Spiral Abyss. Not stackable with Passive Talents that provide the exact same effects.

* The passive does not work in the Serenitea Pot.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 1" %}
### **Regina Probationum**

When Rosaria strikes an opponent from behind using **Ravaging Confession**, Rosaria's CRIT Rate increases by 12% for 5s.

**Notes**
* Either damage instance of **Ravaging Confession** can trigger this passive.
* This CRIT Rate increase shows up in her stat screen, meaning it can be snapshotted by her A4, **Shadow Samaritan**, and included in the CRIT RATE sharing.
* Rosaria doesn't gain the CRIT Rate bonus unless the use of **Ravaging Confession** lands her behind the enemy.
  * If Rosaria starts her skill behind an enemy, but that enemy turns around to face her before the two hits, she won't get the CRIT Rate bonus.  
  * For enemies who don’t have visual distinction between front and behind, Rosaria can still activate her A1 by hitting them from certain angles.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Ascension 4" %}
### **Shadow Samaritan**

Casting **Rites of Termination** increases CRIT Rate of all nearby party members (except Rosaria herself) by 15% of Rosaria's CRIT Rate for 10s.
CRIT Rate Bonus gained this way cannot exceed 15%.

* The CRIT Rate shared by **Shadow Samaritan** can be stacked with external CRIT buffs that show up in a character's stat sheet
  * For example, the CRIT Rate shared by **Shadow Samaritan** stacks with both Hu Tao's A1 talent and Geo MC C1.

{% endtab %}

## **Constellations**
