## Substats Distribution

Substats for artifacts are unevenly distributed, with flat substats weighted higher than other substats, and crit substats weighted lower than other substats.

[Datamined substat probabilities from Dimbreath summarized](https://imgur.com/k2d3S3J)

[Results of simulation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d9nC3x5Ho2lOfmUUMdgKq5h2cZ69VZ_m58OzKlh_muo/) after plugging in some guesses for the main stat and substat probabilities, and comparing those simulated figures to the actual distributions.

* Artifact data from [/u/Acheron-X](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQdCZN4lM23LNfSU36-zEKXC7sXBzeywSGhT1JW9SlqytYXHHFNVXos1yI0UPMqSyTU7KOe36mtjK9d/pubhtml#)

## Other Findings
* For transformative reactions, +80 EM is better than the reaction damage bonus from 4TF/CW at <=490 EM (before set bonus), while +160 EM is better than the reaction damage bonus from 4TF/CW at <=1498 EM (before set bonus).
* Below 842 EM, 2WT+2Ins set bonus brings more value than 4VV for swirl damage before accounting for resistance.
