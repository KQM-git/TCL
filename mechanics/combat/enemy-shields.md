# Enemy Shields

## Introduction

Currently there are two main types of shields that players should be aware of, **Elemental Shields** and **Elemental Armor**. We'll talk about what the differences are between these two shield types, as well as how to eliminate them. **An understanding of Gauge units and ICD is required.**

## Elemental Shields

**Elemental Shields** are shields that **NEED** to be taken down in order to deal direct damage to the enemy HP bar.

To deal with Elemental Shields, you'll need to apply a different **Elemental Aura**. For example, The fastest way to take down a **Cryo Shield** is by applying a total of **6U** **Pyro Aura**. However, **Pyro Aura** is not the only **Aura** that can take down a **Cryo Shield.**

Due to the nature of how ICD works, it is recommended to use different character rotations as opposed to spamming a certain attack, like **Infused Normals**. That being said, **Bow Users** can spam their **Charged Attack** to apply an **aura** over and over because the assumption is that the charge time is longer than the ICD.

Before we get into how to deal with different types of shields, some types \(**Whether its Elemental Shield or Armor\) can** be damaged through **Heavy attacks**, and **Light Attacks**. However, **Light Attacks** do insignificant damage and its advisable to avoid using **Light Attacks** to break **Shields.**

To add onto that, **Geo Attacks** are considered **Heavy Attacks** and also can cause **Crystallize**. Meaning the **GU** required to break **Shields** that are susceptible to both **Geo and Heavy Attacks** is much less in practice.

The following is a table consisting of different types of **Elemental Shields** as well as how many **Gauge units** are required to take them down.[ ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uiJje5yqv7v2UKrWoBAgBMrHrrNemtkooo8JqAGJpP8/edit#gid=162614118)[Character Gauge Units Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uiJje5yqv7v2UKrWoBAgBMrHrrNemtkooo8JqAGJpP8/edit#gid=162614118)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pyro Abyss Mage" %}
| Elemental Aura | Gauge Units Required |
| :--- | :--- |
| Pyro | Null |
| Hydro | 6GU |
| Electro | 12GU |
| Cryo | 24GU |
| Anemo | 24GU |
| Geo | 24GU |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Cryo Abyss Mage" %}
| Elemental Aura | Gauge Units Required |
| :--- | :--- |
| Cryo | Null |
| Hydro | Null |
| Pyro | 6GU |
| Electro | 12GU |
| Anemo | 24GU |
| Geo | 24GU |

**Note: Cryo Elemental Shields** are the only shields that can be damaged with Heavy attacks such as Claymore hits. It takes ~24 Claymore hits to break a **Cryo Elemental Shield.**
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Hydro Abyss Mage" %}
| Elemental Aura | Gauge Units Required |
| :--- | :--- |
| Hydro | Null |
| Cryo | 12GU |
| Pyro | 12GU |
| Electro | 15GU |
| Anemo | 24GU |
| Geo | 24GU |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Slimes" %}
| Cryo Slime | Geo Slimes |
| :--- | :--- |
| 4GU Pyro | 6 Claymore N1 |
| 8GU Electro | 6~7 Ningguang N1 |
| 16GU Anemo | 6~7 Overload Reactions |
| 16GU Geo |  |
| 14 Claymore N1 |  |

**Important: Geo Slimes** can lose their **Shield** through **Crystallize Reaction.** Claymore attacks vary in strength from character to other but the difference should be 1 Normal.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Cryo Cicin Mage" %}
Before we get into how to take down a **Cryo Cicin Mage's Elemental Shield,** first we have to know that the amount of **Cicin** \(or flies\) matter. The less **Cicin** there are, the easier it is to take down their **Shield.  
C=Numbers of Cicin alive.**

| Aura | Gauge Units Required |
| :--- | :--- |
| Pyro | 2GU\*C |
| Electro | 4GU\*C |
| Anemo | 8GU\*C |
| Geo | 8GU\*C |
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Elemental Shield strength varies from domains, abyss, co-op, and overworld. Testing was done in overworld using level 1 Weapons and no Artifacts.**

## Elemental Armor

**Elemental Armor** is the type of shield that protects mobs such as **Stonehide Lawachurl, Fatui, Geo Slimes, and Regisvine bosses.**

One thing to remember is that unlike **Elemental Shields**, it is possible to deal direct damage to enemies protected by **Elemental Armor**. However, the enemy has increased resistances while armored so your damage will be significantly lower.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/zhongli_vs_fatui.png)

The **Elemental Armor** surrounding specifically **Fatui Agents** works in a unique way. Unlike other shield types, they are only damaged by the **Specific Element** that counters them. For instance, an **Electro Fatui's Elemental Armor** will only take damage if inflicted by **Cryo Element.** Other elements deal extremely insignificant damage that it is practically negligible.

The following is a table consisting of different types of **Elemental Armor** as well as how to take them down:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Fatui" %}
| Fatui Type | Aura plus Gauge units |
| :--- | :--- |
| Cryo Fatui | 4GU Pyro |
| Electro Fatui | 4GU Cryo |
| Hydro Fatui | 5GU Electro |
| Anemo Fatui | 1GU Cryo\Hydro\Pyro\Electro |
| Pyro Gunslinger | 4GU Hydro |
| Geochanter | 5~7 Heavy Attacks OR Crystallize Reaction |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Whopperflowers" %}
| Cryo Whopperflower | Pyro Whopperflower |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1GU Pyro | 1GU Hydro |
| 2GU Electro | 2GU Electro |
| 4GU Anemo | 4GU Cryo |
| 4GU Geo | 4GU Anemo |
| Cryo\Hydro **Null** | 4GU Geo |
| 4 Claymore N1 |  |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Lawachurls" %}
| Stonehide Lawachurl | Frostarm Lawachurl |
| :--- | :--- |
| 11 Claymore N1 during 24 Seconds | 15GU Pyro |
| ~9 Overload during 45 Seconds | 30GU Electro |
| 5 Ningguang N1 | 60GU Anemo |
|  | 60GU Geo |
|  |  |

Note that both **Stonehide Lawachrul** and **Frostarm Lawachurl** armor decays each second for up to 90 seconds.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Regisvine" %}
| Pyro Regisvine \(Core\) | Cryo Regisvine \(Core\) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 6GU Hydro | 6GU Pyro |
| 12GU Electro | 12GU Electro |
| 24GU Cryo | ~24 Claymore N1 |
| 24GU Anemo | 24GU Anemo |
| 24GU Geo | 24GU Geo |

**IMPORTANT:** These values are for **Aura** applied to the **Core** of the **Regisvine.** It takes **HALF** the **GU** of each element to break the shield protecting the **EYE**. So for example, it only takes **6GU Electro** to break the eye of either **Regisvine.**
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Mitachurl Shields

**Mitachurl Shields** are rather different than other types of shields. For one, they only protect the **Mitachurls** from **one direction only.** There aren't any special mechanics as to how they work, and dealing with them is quite simple as well.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Wooden Mitachurl" %}
* **Wooden Mitachurl's** shields can be taken down by applying **Pyro Aura**. However, when you apply **Pyro** to the **Wooden Mitachurl's** Shield, he will attempt to extinguish it. There are two ways to deal with that:  A\) Keep attacking him while the **Pyro Aura** is burning his shield so he is forced to guard. B\) Apply another **Pyro Aura** as soon as he extinguishes the first one and the shield will burn. 
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Rockshield Mitachurl" %}
**Rockshield Mitachurl's** shield is considered a **Geo Shield**. Therefore, you will need **Heavy attacks, Geo Attacks, or Overload.**

* ~18 Claymore N1
* ~15 Overload reactions 
* 16 Ningguang N1
* Applying **Cryo** **Aura** then causing **Crystallize** with **Geo Element** is very effective in taking down the **Rockshield Mitachurl's** shield. 
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Iceshield Mitachurl" %}
* 6GU Pyro
* ~3 Overload Reactions
* While **Claymore Attacks** can damage the **Iceshield Mitachurl's Shield,** the shield has a regenerate mechanic which makes it hard for **Claymore Attacks** to outpace the **Shield Regeneration.** Therefore, its best to take down the shield using **Pyro Aura.**
