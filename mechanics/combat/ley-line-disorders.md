# Ley Line Disorders

Ley Line Disorders operate by setting your party's gauge to the following characteristics:

### Hydro: Slowing Waters

| Domain | GU | Decay Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cecilia Garden 1-3 | 1GU | 30s per GU |
| Cecilia Garden 4 | 2GU | 15s per GU |

### Pyro: Smoldering Flames

| Domain | GU | Decay Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tiashan Mansion 1-3 | 1GU | 20s per GU |
| Tiashan Mansion 4 | 2GU | 10s per GU |

* There is currently a bug where the burn ticks themselves are applying 1GU pyro to the active character, and can therefore be extended beyond its intended duration.

### Cryo: Condensed Ice

| Domain | GU | Decay Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Forsaken Rift 1-3 | 1GU | 20s per GU |
| Forsaken Rift 4 | 2GU | 10s per GU |

### Electro: Engulfing Storm

| Domain | GU | Decay Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Lianshan 1-3 | 1GU | 20s per GU |
| Lianshan 4 | 2GU | 10s per GU |

Other auras applied to your characters beforehand are removed entirely and do not affect the resulting gauges in any way. Aura duration can be reduced by applying gauges to your own characters through elemental skills and bursts, specific resonances, and artifact set bonuses. The first application of the disorder occurs 3 seconds after starting the challenge and every 30 seconds thereafter.

### Black Aura
There exists a "**Black Aura**" that can be found in Abyss and Inazuma Bounties. It releases a shockwave of a random element (although just like with Geovishaps, the type of element is determined beforehand).  
So far, only **Hydro**, **Electro** and **Cryo** have appeared as Black Aura in the game.

| Cooldown | GU | Multiplier | Element |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 15s | 2GU | 400% | Depends |
