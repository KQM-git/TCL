**Notes**

* The **Lightning Orb** bounces to nearby targets with the small AoE spreading **Conductive** stacks each bounce
  * This means in tight enough groups, it can apply all 3 stacks in a single Press E.
  * **Conductive** stacks last 15s with independent timers. Beyond 3 **Conductive** stacks, additional applications will refresh the stack(s) with the least remaining duration.
  * As **Conductive** stacks are an enemy attribute, multiple players using Lisa in co-op share **Conductive** stacks consumption and stacking.
* The hitbox of Lisa's Hold E is a cylinder with the following dimensions/attributes:
  * Its Radius is indicated by its VFX and mobs' centers have to be inside said radius in order to take damage.
  * Its Height/Depth is either unlimited or absurdly large. This is difficult to properly quantize.
  * Its hitbox can clip through the terrain, allowing it to connect with enemies that are out of Lisa's direct Line of Sight.
* Lisa can Utilize Pyro/Cryo with her Press E variant of **Violet Arc** to Stack **Conductive** Stacks
  * When an opponent affected by Pyro or Cryo is struck, the mob directly hit will immediately gain 2 **Conductive** Stacks, and others in the resulting Overload or Superconduct radius will gain 1 **Conductive** Stack
  * If Violet Arc connects and causes Overload or Superconduct while in a Pyro or Cryo-environment \(the most common ones being Burning Grass and Frozen Water\), the direct hit mob will obtain 3 **Conductive** stacks and will radiate 2 stacks to nearby opponents.
  * If 2 opponents are nearby and only one is afflicted with a status, if the afflicted mob is hit, both enemies will gain 3 stacks of **Conductive**

**Notes**

* **Lightning Rose** has an unlisted instance of damage on initial summon
  * Summon damage is 10% at all talent levels.
  * Summon damage does not apply an Electro Aura.
  * Summon damage does not apply the DEF shred from **Static Electricity Field** \(A4\).
* Enemy targeting seems fully randomized between all opponents in-range.
* Discharges from **Lightning Rose** have a small AoE on impact. In tight enemy groups, a lightning bolt can deal damage to multiple enemies at once.
* The hitbox of Lisa's Lightning Rose is a cylinder with the following dimensions/attributes:
  * Its Radius is indicated by its VFX and mobs' centers have to be inside said radius in order to take damage. Misleadingly, the actual area is not the flowered decal, but the soft tinted circle of purple.
  * Its Height/Depth is either unlimited or absurdly large. This is difficult to properly quantize.
  * Its hitbox can clip through terrain (allowing it to connect with enemies that are out of Lisa's direct Line of Sight); see Azhdaha.
* Surrounding opponents are only launched if made airborne while their poise is broken. Poise-broken grounded enemies are frequently staggered instead.
* The initial Summon DMG dealt by **Lightning Rose** is dealt once within a specific area.
  * This area is a flat circular plane which shares the radius of **Lightning Rose** (7m).
  * The Summon DMG cannot deal damage to enemies whose hurtboxes are below or above near the suspended plane of which **Lightning Rose** was casted on.
* More than one **Lightning Roses** can co-exist with sufficient cooldown reduction.

**Notes**

* The description is misleading. **Plasma Eruption** changes the number of lightning bolts to 1-3, not 2-4 as implied by the wording.
  * For more details, see the [full entry](../../evidence/characters/electro/lisa.md#c4-description-and-actual-effects-are-miscommunicated) in Lisa's Evidence Vault.
* In tight enemy groups, **Plasma Eruption** can quadratically increase the damage of **Lightning Rose** due to the AoE of each lightning bolt released.

**Notes**

* The pulse visual effect and cooldown are not initiated when not in combat, but will still apply **Conductive** stacks nearby.
* The radius of this effect is 5m and its height is seemingly infinite, regardless of whether or not Lisa is in combat.
