# Fall Damage

Fall damage occurs when an enemy hits the ground or a wall with a certain velocity and inflicts a percentage of their maximum health as damage. This damage is inflicted as physical damage but is not boosted by Superconduct or Phys DMG% bonuses \[[1](../../../evidence/combat-mechanics/damage/other/fall-damage.md#sc-and-phys-bonus-dont-affect-fall-damage)\].
