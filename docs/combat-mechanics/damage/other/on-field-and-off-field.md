# On-Field and Off-Field

## On-Hit and On-Field

Not all on-hit abilities require the character to be on-field during the hit to be triggered. For a list of Talents, Constellations, and weapon and artifact passives tested, see this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S_Toll_6qIO1q2ood0KPteVH0-lw3mAPTKqEkmJeo9U/edit?usp=sharing).  

### On-Hit Effects During Burst

Passives that trigger on getting hit or damaged (such as Serpent Spine passive, The Bell passive) will trigger if the player is hit during Elemental Burst cast.

## On-CRIT Effects

Bloom-related Reaction DMG under DMG ICD can still trigger certain on-CRIT effects such as Xinyan C1.
