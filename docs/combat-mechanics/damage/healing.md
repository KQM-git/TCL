# Healing

## General Formula

$$
\text{Healing} = \text{BaseHealing} \times (1+\text{OutgoingHealingBonus}+\text{IncomingHealingBonus})
$$

See the sections below for the breakdown of each individual part of the formula.

:::info
While OutgoingHealingBonus and IncomingHealingBonus are additive, the former is a stat of the healing source while the latter is a stat of the character being healed.
:::

## Base Healing

$$
\text{BaseHealing} =
\begin{cases}
  (\text{Talent \%} \times \text{ATK})+\text{FlatTalent} & \text{if, Healing scales with ATK} \\
  (\text{Talent \%} \times \text{DEF})+\text{FlatTalent} & \text{if, Healing scales with DEF} \\
  (\text{Talent \%} \times \text{Max HP})+\text{FlatTalent} & \text{if, Healing scales with Max HP}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\text{ATK} = (\text{AttackCharacter} + \text{AttackWeapon}) \times (1 + \text{AttackBonus}) + \text{FlatAttack}
$$

$$
\text{DEF} = \text{DefenseCharacter} \times (1 + \text{DefenseBonus}) + \text{FlatDefense}
$$

$$
\text{Max HP} = \text{HealthCharacter} \times (1 + \text{HealthBonus}) + \text{FlatHealth}
$$
