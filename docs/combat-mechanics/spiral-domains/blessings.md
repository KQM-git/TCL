After the challenge begins, when the active character's Elemental Energy is greater than or equal to 50%, they will continuously release shockwaves that deal DMG to opponents. When their Elemental Energy reaches 100%, these shockwaves will deal even greater DMG.

* The DMG of this Blessing is based on enemy level and is unaffected by ATK, DMG%, CRIT, character level, and resistance.
* True DMG from Blessings in Spiral Abyss have different base DMG depending on the blessing. However, the damage all scale exactly according to the enemy/environment level multiplier listed in the TCL, using the level of the enemies in the current chamber.
