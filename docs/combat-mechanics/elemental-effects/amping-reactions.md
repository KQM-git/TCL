# Amping Reactions

<AmplifyingReaction />

Amping reactions scale on EM, reaction bonuses, and the damage of the attack triggering the reaction. Since they scale off of base damage, Amping reactions can make use of Crit/ATK stats of a character as opposed to just their EM and level. There are also reaction bonuses to further amplify this, which currently only exist in the form of the 4 Crimson Witch set and Mona's C1.

## Melt

Melt is an elemental reaction triggered by applying Pyro onto a target already afflicted with Cryo or vice versa. Melt allows for a multiplier of damage amplification onto the attack triggering the reaction, heavily boosting the attack. Applying Cryo onto Pyro is colloquially referred to as a Reverse Melt as it has the smaller base multiplier of 1.5x as opposed to the 2x multiplier of Pyro onto Cryo.

## Vaporize

Vaporize is an elemental reaction triggered by applying Hydro onto a target already afflicted with Pyro or vice versa. Vaporize allows for a multiplier of damage amplification onto the attack triggering the reaction, heavily boosting the attack. Applying Pyro onto Hydro is colloquially referred to as a Reverse Vape as it has the smaller base multiplier of 1.5x as opposed to the 2x multiplier of Hydro onto Pyro.
