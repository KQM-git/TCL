## Trial Character Resonances

All Trial Characters in Story Quests and Hangouts do not contribute to or benefit from the party's Elemental Resonances.

## Swirl Chain Reactions Can Trigger Electro Resonance

Swirling Hydro, Pyro, or Cryo onto an enemy affected by Electro or vice versa will trigger **High Voltage**. This shares the particle generation cooldown with when you trigger it normally.

## Cryo Resonance Applies Crit Rate For Cryo Before Reactions

Cryo resonance determines if an enemy has Cryo for its buff before reactions remove auras.
