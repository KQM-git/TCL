# Amplifying Reactions

## Formula

import AmplifyingReaction from '../\_formulas/amplifying.md'

<AmplifyingReaction />

Amplifying Reactions scale off of EM, Reaction DMG Bonuses, and the damage of the attack triggering the reaction. Since they scale off of base damage, Amplifying Reactions can make use of CRIT, ATK, EM, and character level. There are also Reaction DMG Bonuses to further amplify this, which currently only exist in the form of  [4-Piece Crimson Witch](../../equipment/artifacts.md#crimson-witch-of-flames) and [Mona C1](../../characters/hydro/mona.md#constellations).

## Melt

Melt is an Amplifying Reaction triggered by applying Pyro onto a target already afflicted with Cryo or vice versa. Melt allows for a multiplier of damage amplification onto the attack triggering the reaction, heavily boosting the attack. Applying Cryo onto Pyro is colloquially referred to as a Reverse Melt as it has the smaller base multiplier of 1.5x as opposed to the 2x multiplier of Pyro onto Cryo.

## Vaporize

Vaporize, or Vape, is an Amplifying Reaction triggered by applying Hydro onto a target already afflicted with Pyro or vice versa. Vaporize allows for a multiplier of damage amplification onto the attack triggering the reaction, heavily boosting the attack. Applying Pyro onto Hydro is colloquially referred to as a Reverse Vape as it has the smaller base multiplier of 1.5x as opposed to the 2x multiplier of Hydro onto Pyro.
