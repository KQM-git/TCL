# Eleventh of the Fatui Harbingers - Tartaglia - First form

He draws power from the ominous Delusion he possesses and fights using martial arts that he learned in a land of darkness. He is a pure warrior with an insatiable lust for battle. Each bloody conflict, each life-and-death struggle is a delightful trial to him. People say that the young Childe is famed throughout the land for his battle prowess. But he has never taken big talk of this kind to heart. After all..."You shall ever be the eye of the storm,"And the clashing of steel shall ever accompany you."The pitch-black memory of stepping into uttermost darkness,"Shall, at last, become the strength by which you will overturn this world."

## Attacks

* Any attack that hits the player will leave a Riptide mark.
  * Attacks that hit characters already marked by Riptide will deal additional AoE Hydro DMG.
  * The mark can be removed by touching the arena's barrier to trigger a Vaporize reaction. This reaction does not deal damage to the character.
  * The mark can also be removed with characters that apply certain elements to themselves or other characters.
  * The mark will persist even if you switch characters.
* Creates a Hydro shield that blocks a certain amount of damage.
  * If the player attacks Tartaglia enough while his shield is up, he will attack the player with a quick counter attack slash.
* Shoots out a huge Hydro energy blast in front of him that deals very high damage.
  * This triggers if Childe gets hit by any Hydro attacks while his Hydro Shield is up.
* Performs one charged slash attack forward.
* Unleashes energy deep within, creating a domain of Hydro energy that deals a moderate amount of Hydro DMG around him.
* Performs a spinning slash, dealing Hydro DMG around him.
* Performs up to 6 consecutive shots with a bow while aiming at the player.
  * Tartaglia becomes vulnerable after performing this skill.
* Performs up to 6 consecutive shots with a bow upwards that fall to deal AoE Hydro DMG.
  * This attack is only performed if a target is marked with riptide.
* Unleashes 2 to 6 consecutive shark-shaped waves with a bow.
* Slides quickly to any point of the arena, dealing Hydro DMG in his wake.
  * This move is performed when the player is too far away.
* Charges for a while, then unleashes 4 arrows upwards that fall from the sky to deal massive AoE Hydro DMG around him.
* Charges for a while, then unleashes a massive humpback whale-shaped attack, dealing massive AoE Hydro DMG.
  * This attack is only performed if a target is marked with riptide.
  * The horned whale-shaped creature will first deal damage upon emerging from the ground in front of Childe, then jump forward and crash down to deal damage again on impact.
  * This attack cannot be invincibility frame dodged by dashing. However, certain Elemental Bursts last long enough that when timed correctly, their invincibility frames can completely nullify damage from this attack.

Upon depleting Childe's health bar, he will become invulnerable, heal back to full health, and transform into his second form.
