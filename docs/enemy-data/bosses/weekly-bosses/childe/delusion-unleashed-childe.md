## Delusion Unleashed - Childe - Second form

He draws power from the ominous Delusion he possesses and fights using martial arts that he learned in a land of darkness. He is a pure warrior with an insatiable lust for battle. Each bloody conflict, each life-and-death struggle is a delightful trial to him. People say that the young Childe is famed throughout the land for his battle prowess. But he has never taken big talk of this kind to heart. After all..."You shall ever be the eye of the storm,"And the clashing of steel shall ever accompany you."The pitch-black memory of stepping into uttermost darkness,"Shall, at last, become the strength by which you will overturn this world."

## Attacks

* Any attack that hits the player will leave a Riptide mark.  
* Attacks that hit characters already marked by Riptide will deal additional AoE Electro DMG.
  * The mark can be removed by touching the arena's barrier to trigger an Overloaded reaction. This reaction does not deal damage to the character but may cause the character to be knocked back.
  * The mark can also be removed with characters that apply certain elements to themselves or other characters
