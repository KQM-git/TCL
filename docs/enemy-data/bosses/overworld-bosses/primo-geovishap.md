## Attacks

* The Primo Geovishap is always encountered in an idle state in one of the four elements; Pyro, Hydro, Cryo or Electro. This additional element is indicated by the color of the scales on it.
* Certain attacks will produce stones that detonate after a few seconds delay, dealing elemental damage of the currently infused element.
  * Although the stones themselves, when created, deal no damage, the explosion(s) that occur do deal damage.
  * Each element has different effects on the stones:
    Pyro-Infused Stones: Leaves a large pool of lava in its wake for a while, dealing continuous Pyro damage to characters in the affected area.
    Hydro-Infused Stones: Cause seven small eruptions that deal Hydro damage. Each eruption occurs close to the stone's original position.
    Cryo-Infused Stones: Generates a ring of ice spikes that start from the center of the stone and propagate (up to 3 times) outward, dealing Cryo damage within a moderate area.
    Electro-Infused Stones: Explodes in an X-like pattern, dealing Electro damage.
* Quickly punches at the player.
* Looks behind itself, then performs a quick spinning attack. This attack is heavily prioritized if any players are behind the Primo Geovishap.
* Claws in front of itself once.
* Attack forward twice, and ends with a slam towards the player.
* Targets outside Primo Geovishap's melee reach will cause it to submerge underground and dig towards the enemy, creating Elemental-Infused Stones as it travels. It will also damage characters on contact as it bores through the ground. Upon reaching its destination, it resurfaces and performs a slam.
* Raises up its tail and scatter a number of rune-covered rocks around the arena that will explode after a short while, dealing the current type of infused elemental.
  * The attack itself does no damage.
* Unleash a breath of pure elemental power, whilst arcing the attack in a cone-like area in front of itself, dealing heavy elemental damage of the currently infused element.
* Spawns a barrage of Elemental-Infused stones around itself.
  * The attack itself deals no damage and can only be used once Primo Geovishap reaches critical health (Approximately less than 10% Max HP).
* Unleashes a blast of pure elemental power in a huge AoE around it, dealing immense elemental damage of the currently infused element.
* Will not be performed once Primo Geovishap reaches critical health (Approximately less than 10% Max HP) and will instead perform the attack above.
* If the player is protected by a shield, no damage will be taken and isntead the Primo Geovishap will loss a large amount of health, be knocked back and temporarily lose a large amount of resistances.
