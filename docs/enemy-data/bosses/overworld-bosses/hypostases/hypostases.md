## Anemo Hypostasis - Beth

![](/img/enemy/bosses/Enemy_Anemo_Hypostasis_Icon.webp)

Code name: Beth. A high-purity Anemo entity.Elemental hypostases are life forms which have completely abandoned their former appearance and biological structure, making them able to reach the highest level of elemental purity.Research into hypostases is mainly led by scholars of Sumeru Akademiya, but due to the level of danger that they pose, little of substance is known about hypostases beyond their scientific name and code name.

## Energy drops

| HP Threshold | Type  | Element |
| :----------- | :---- | :------ |
| 75% HP       | 1 orb | anemo   |
| 50% HP       | 1 orb | anemo   |
| 25% HP       | 1 orb | anemo   |
| Death        | 1 orb | anemo   |

## Attacks

* For most of the attacks below, the core will be exposed for a few seconds after the boss uses the attack. Use this opportunity to deal damage to the boss. Most of the attacks the Hypostasis does are Anemo.
* Flies into the air and turns into a giant crystalfly, then shoots 2 blasts at the player; the first blast is aimed towards the player's location, while the second is a follow-up that hits those struck by the first.
* Teleports to the center of the arena and spirals high into the air, forming a tornado beneath it. Over the next few seconds, forms 8 tornadoes around the arena, these tornados move randomly and don't target the player.
  * The tornadoes will cause Elemental Absorption if they come into contact with Hydro, Pyro, Cryo, or Electro, and will leave behind an orb of their respective infusion in the air once the attack ends. If not infused with anything, they simply remain Anemo. Picking up these orbs grants 3 Energy particles of the respective element.
* Quickly flies next to the player and forms a ring of shell pieces that create a vacuum which pulls the player towards the core while dealing constant damage. After a short time, it will pull in the shell pieces and implode.
* Quickly flies next to the player and forms a large wall, which folds in a "clapping" motion very quickly, dealing damage in an area in front of the wall.
* Teleports next to the player and forms a spinning dome formation with its shell. It will then proceed to take 3 random orbs in the air, healing 5% of its health for each one and unleashes a large shockwave in the process.
  * By default, this deals Anemo damage, but will deal Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, or Electro damage if it pulls in that orb.
* Moves to a location away from the player and sends pieces of its shell into the sky. Over the next few seconds, three total shell pieces will fall from the sky towards the player, these leave updrafts where they fall.
  * The boss will not expose its core after this move, but its core will be exposed during the attack.
* Moves to a location away from the player and floats into the sky, forming a rhombus with its shell pieces. Then, it sucks shell pieces into its core to form and fire wind blasts that deal AoE damage, it fires a total of 3 blasts. Move around to dodge (can dodge without dashing).
* When HP is low (approx. 5%), moves to the center of the arena and forms 4 large floating Anemo Orbs along with several updrafts. After some time , absorbs any Anemo Orbs that remain, healing a large portion of its HP for each orb absorbed.
* If an orb is absorbed by the player it will not respawn the next time the Hypostasis uses Second Wind, and if all orbs are absorbed by the player it will become unable to reuse this ability and unable to heal.
* The boss can't be killed without resolving this attack first.

## Cryo Hypostasis - Daleth

![](/img/enemy/bosses/Enemy_Cryo_Hypostasis_Icon.webp)

Code name: Daleth. A high-purity Cryo entity.Research suggests that there are subtle differences between elemental hypostases and other elemental life forms in terms of their physical composition. Perhaps these differences can account for their high level of homeostasis and their almost mechanical movements.

## Energy drops

| HP Threshold | Type  | Element |
| :----------- | :---- | :------ |

## Attacks

* For most of the attacks below, the core will be exposed for a few seconds after the boss uses the attack. Use this opportunity to deal damage to the boss.
* Creates a barrier of detonating icicles around itself while spawning icicles where the player is standing with a short delay.
* Quickly flies next to the player and forms a large wall, which folds in a "clapping" motion very quickly, dealing damage in an area in front of the wall.
* Transforms into a wheel that travels in a straight line towards the player that leaves a damaging Cryo trail behind it. This attack may turn up to three times in a row.
* Flies into the air and forms a rhombus with its' shell pieces before firing each of them at the player.
  * The trajectory of these projectiles is curved.
  * The core is exposed during this attack.
* Forms a "skirt" of icicles which it shoots in three rings of increasing diameter. The last ring creates an area of Cryo that damages the player when stood on or jumped over.
* When HP is low (approx. 5%), teleports to the center of the arena and forms a thick icy shield around the core. While maintaining this state, summons several Frostfruits around it while regenerating a percentage of HP every second.
  * Homing Icicles will be fired periodically during this phase.
  * Players are able to use Charged Attacks against the fallen Frostfruits to destroy the shield and expose the core.
  * The fallen Frostfruits will be placed at different distances depending on how far away the player is from the boss.
  * The boss can't be killed without resolving this attack first.

## Pyro Hypostasis - Ayin

![](/img/enemy/bosses/Enemy_Pyro_Hypostasis_Icon.webp)

Code Name: Ayin. A high-purity Pyro entity. Elemental hypostases have the ability to often enter a sort of "emergency restart" phase when they are about to be destroyed and can revive themselves in this way. Such rapid regeneration is not possessed even by most creatures for whom survival is the top priority.

## Attacks

* For most of the attacks below, the core will be exposed for a few seconds after the boss uses the attack. Use this opportunity to deal damage to the boss.
* Has 2 states, ignited and extinguished.
  * Starts the battle ignited. While ignited, it will have a protective pyro armor, which is resistant to most elements but especially weak against hydro aura application.
  * In the ignited state, if its HP is less than 50%, it will regenerate 5% HP after every attack, including after reigniting.
    While in Ignited State:
* Arranges itself as a molten boar that charges at the player before periodically surfacing above ground, then turns into a giant hand that leaps into the player's general location.
  * Sometimes it may do a follow-up attack, emerging at the player's general location and explodeing. The Hypostasis will disappear momentarily after exploding.
* Forms itself into a giant ball that curves at the player's location, leaving a damaging Pyro trail behind it.
* When near the player, it levitates high above ground, and plunges back down. This creates a Shockwave.
* Arranges itself into a Pyro Serpent that fires 3 damaging fireballs at the player's general location.
* Forms a giant ball that cracks open slowly. After some time, it causes a heavy explosion that does massive AoE Pyro DMG over the whole field.
  While in Extinguished State:
* Flies into the air and forms a rhombus with its' shell pieces, firing them quickly from top to bottom.
  * The core will be exposed during this attack.
* Creates a barrier of sorts around itself, targeting random areas and sending a Pyro pillar at said locations, before recalling them, leaving a patch of fire in said area.
* Spins around while taking on the form of a rocket, deploying three Fire Seeds to reignite itself.
  * The amount of fuel regained is dependent on how many seeds were not extinguished, with a small amount restored if all seeds were extinguished.
  * The progress of refueling will be visible under the boss' health bar.
  * The Fire Seeds can be destroyed using elemental aura application.
* Like all other Hypostases, it has a Clap Move. Quickly flies next to the player and forms a large wall, which folds in a "clapping" motion very quickly, dealing damage in an area in front of the wall.
