# Abyss Herald: Wicked Torrents

These silent figures are the vanguard of the Abyss, brandishing Tidal Blades that can engulf everything in an instant, crumpling armor and obliterating heretics. They shall bring preordained damnation upon the foolish masses.

## Attacks

* Performs a series of slash attacks, within the Hydro shield form the slashing pattern will change.

* Raises both arms before unleashing a cross-shaped water projectile towards the player. If hit by this projectile, the elemental skill & burst of the active character will have their on-going cooldown increased by 6 seconds.

* Conjures one or two concentrated water projectiles with its' blades and fires them forward.

* After falling to 20% health, the Abyss Herald will remove its' remaining health to imbue itself with a powerful Hydro shield. Breaking this shield will kill the Herald. Once the shield is activated, nearby players are knocked back from the Herald and damaged. The Herald also gains new/upgraded attacks when it is equipped with the Hydro shield.

* Turns into a spinning wheel and charges at the player. The number of charges the Abyss Herald will perform depends on how much health it has left. If the Herald is above 50% health, it only lunges once at the player. If the Herald is below 50% health, it lunges twice. In Hydro shield form, it will lunge three times. If the Hydro shield is below half strength, it will lunge four times.

* Slashes the air numerous times with its' blade before unleashing 8 Hydro projectiles in a circular pattern. This attack is only used when the Herald is in its' Hydro shield form. If hit by any of those projectiles, the elemental skill & burst of the active character will have their on-going cooldown increased by 6 seconds.
