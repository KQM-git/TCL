## Rifthounds

## Rockfond Rifthound

They do display certain biological behaviors similar to those of real wolves. Perhaps they feel jealousy towards these their "next of kin," and dream of replacing them someday.

## Attacks

* Corrosion: When their attacks hit a character, that character and other characters in the party will be afflicted by the Corrosion status, losing HP every second. 
  * Shielded characters will not be immune to corrosion.
* The Rifthound swipes at the player with their claws.
* The Rifthound temporarily turns invisible to attack the player from another direction.
* If struck with the same element of their affinity, they will accumulate Rage. When filled, their attacks become more dangerous but their resistance against their aligned element decreases.
* If the player is far away, they will charge a ball of energy on their tails and launch it at the player.
* The Rifthound dive bombs the player in a manner similar to the Thunder Manifestation.

## Thundercraven Rifthound

Once upon a time, they ran riot across the continent, but they went extinct for a time due to resistance and mass hunts. Recently, however, they have re-emerged. The pack of black wolves that now threaten Springvale and Wolvendom are such creatures.
