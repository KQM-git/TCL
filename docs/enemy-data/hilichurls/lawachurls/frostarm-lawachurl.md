# Frostarm Lawachurl

This huge hilichurl is referred to as a "lawa" by its brethren. Its body, honed to the very limit, almost seems to blend into its Cryo-filled environment, and its stoic nobility is like that of the frozen northland rivers.

## Attacks

* Punches its' chest and gives a battle cry before infusing itself with a cryo armor. This attack will always be the first one attempted at the start of the fight, and can be done again after the armor is broken.
  * While protected by the armor, certain attacks will be upgraded.
* Takes a wide right swing at the player.
* Takes a left swing followed up by a right punch into the ground.
* Goes into a crouch start position, and after a short delay quickly dashes in the direction of the player, inflicting large body slam damage.
  * Armor Upgrade: While dashing, it will leave multiple cryo mines along its' path. Those mines will explode once the player touches them.
* Executes a high, long jump to the player's location, dealing massive damage on its' landing.
  * Armor Upgrade: Freezes the ground on the landing spot, continuously dealing damage to the player if standing in it.
* Leans forward, grabbing multiple cryo slimes to throw at the player from ranged distance. This move will not spawn any slimes, they're simply projectiles.
  * Armor Upgrade: Grabs a single large cryo slime instead.
* The following attack can only be used while protected by the armor: Smashes the ground with both fists, raising up a multitude of cryo spikes from the ground in a short radius around it.
