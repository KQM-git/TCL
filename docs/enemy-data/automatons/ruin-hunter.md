# Ruin Hunter

They are said to be remnants from a lost ancient nation. It seems that the creators opted to forgo the low-performing humanoid-design in pursuit of improved combat effectiveness. They are extremely dangerous both in melee and ranged combat. Considering these mere relics possess such extraordinary power, one cannot help but wonder what the civilization that produced them must have looked like at its height.

## Weakspot Details

While in Bombardment Mode (Flying), the core inside him will be exposed. For unknown reasons this core counts as a weakspot but will not trigger certain effects related to it (ex. prototype crescent).

## Attacks

* The Ruin Hunter transforms it's left arm into a blade and raise it up, then quickly slashes once in front of itself.

* It transforms and raises its' right arm, then attacks twice forward, followed by a spinning slash, ended by one final slash.

  * On occasions when it'll end a the combo above, it has a chance to perform a far-reaching sideways spin at the end, dealing heavy Damage.

* If the player roams too far, it will change its' right hand to a drill and prepare to strike, after 2 seconds it will instantly charge towards the player, covering tons of distance in the process, dealing immense Damage.

* The Ruin Hunter may occasionally enter "Bombardment Mode" by detaching its' limbs which then serve as its' propulsion, pushing all nearby players away, and becoming airborne for a while or until its' core is hit. It will immediately enter this mode of attack if it's current target is too high or low in elevation. While parked in the air, its' core weak spot is exposed, and may perform one of the four following attacks:

  * All thrusters point the sky and fire a barrage of 8 missiles into the air which shortly after, strike the ground randomly in a grid-like fashion. These missiles have a large AoE. This attack can be performed up to 10 times.

  * If the player roams too far, the Ruins Hunter will fire 4 quick volleys of bullets toward its' target.

  * If the player roams too far, the Ruins Hunter will shoot multiple missiles that can home in on the player. This attack is followed up with the Ruin Hunter charging up for a few seconds to unleash a focused beam attack, dealing immense Damage.

  * All four thrusters face downward and quickly spin before unleashing four simultaneous laser blasts, directly below itself. After this attack is performed, it will exit Bombardment Mode and return to the ground.

* If the player hits the Ruin Hunter's weakspot core in Bombardment Mode, it'll cause it to exit it's form, fall down and be temporarily stunned.
