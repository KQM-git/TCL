# Automaton

## Ruin Defender

Legend has it that they were war machines left behind by a nation that had been destroyed. Compared to the more common Ruin Guards, their design has greater value in the study of biomimesis. The insect-like limbs are more agile than humanoid machines. The shield formed by each part can resist any frontal attack.
