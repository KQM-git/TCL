## Slimes

<TabItem value="anemo" label="Anemo">

## Anemo Slime

![](/img/enemy/elemental/Enemy_Anemo_Slime_Icon.webp)

It is able to float in the air to a certain degree due to the power of Anemo.

## Weakspot Details

Anemo Slimes at any level will instantly die if they take any damage during their airborne attacks.

## Attacks

* Anemo slimes will bounce to move around while in combat. They will not attack the player from the point-blank range, but will instead move away from their target first. Upon distancing itself from the target they will jump up a bit and inflate before deflating to launch itself at their target. After completing the attack, it will immediately begin to move away again, preparing for the next attack.

<TabItem value="cryo" label="Cryo">

## Cryo Slime

![](/img/enemy/elemental/Enemy_Cryo_Slime_Icon.webp)

Competitors once spread malicious rumors that the Dawn Winery used Cryo Slimes to control the temperature of their wine cellar and preserve the quality of their alcohol.

## Attacks

* Upon entering combat, they will first distance themselves from their target. After reaching a "safe distance", they will move closer to hit their target by pouncing at it. After successfully completing the attack, they will retreat again.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="dendro" label="Dendro">

## Dendro Slime

![](/img/enemy/elemental/Enemy_Dendro_Slime_Icon.webp)

It has also taken on the weaknesses of the Dendro element, and will burn intensely the moment it meets a bright flame.

## Attacks

* When coming near it, it will hide underground. They will remain hidden until the player turns their back and walks away, in which case it'll take a peek for safety. If it's safe, it will relocate closer to the player's position, and if close enough it will attack the player with a pounce attack. If the player turns around during the peek or reposition, it will panic and run away from the player, going back to hiding. They can also be pushed out of hiding if they are either forcefully pulled out of the earth, or burnt with a pyro attack. The Dendro Slime will be ignited for large amounts of damage when entering contact with pyro aura. Once out of the ground, it will act like a normal slime, distancing it's self in order to attack the player with pounce attack.

<TabItem value="electro" label="Electro">

## Electro Slime

![](/img/enemy/elemental/Enemy_Electro_Slime_Icon.webp)

According to analyses, the jumping of Electro Slimes reflects the electric potential difference in the ground. In areas brimming over with Electro, their unusual movements can be observed and used to avoid danger.

# Attacks

Upon entering combat, they will first distance themselves from their target. After reaching a "safe distance", they will move closer to hit their target by pouncing at it. After successfully completing the attack, they will retreat again.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="geo" label="Geo">

## Geo Slime

![](/img/enemy/elemental/Enemy_Geo_Slime_Icon.webp)

Generally speaking, the crust of the earth is filled with Geo energy. Geo Slimes that are formed this way have a similarly "down-to-earth" sort of feeling.

## Attacks

* Upon entering combat, they will first distance themselves from their target. After reaching a "safe distance", they will move closer to hit their target by pouncing at it. After successfully completing the attack, they will retreat again.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="hydro" label="Hydro">

## Hydro Slime

![](/img/enemy/elemental/Enemy_Hydro_Slime_Icon.webp)

Legend has it that some people would use Hydro Slimes as an emergency water source, packing them in preparation for travels through dry regions or deep domains. But due to the high concentration of Hydro within these slimes, direct ingestion is, in fact, harmful to the human body.

## Attacks

* Upon entering combat, they will first distance themselves from their target. After reaching a "safe distance", they will move closer to hit their target by pouncing at it. After successfully completing the attack, they will retreat again.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pyro" label="Pyro">

## Pyro Slime

![](/img/enemy/elemental/Enemy_Pyro_Slime_Icon.webp)

Its intelligence is very basic, but its uses are just as broad â€” well, for hilichurls, that is.

## Attacks

* Upon entering combat, they will first ignite themselves, then distance themselves from their target. After reaching a "safe distance", they will move closer to hit their target by pouncing at it. After successfully completing the attack, they will retreat again.
  If defeated while ignited, it will explode after a short delay, dealing AoE Pyro damage.  
  When extinguished, a Pyro Slime may attempt to move away from its target to reignite, if given an opportunity during combat or after the battle ends.
