## Attacks

* Infues itself with a hydro armor, gaining great resistance and empowering certain attacks. The armor will have its' resistance against most elements increased, but has a great weakness to electro elemental application.
* Charges up for a brief moment, then shoots a single bubble bullet at the player.
  * While armored: the bubble bullet is much faster.
* Throws a hydro bubble at its' ally, healing it.
  * While armored: heals for more.
