## Attacks

* Charges up for a medium interval, then smashes its' hammer into the ground.
  * While armored: the smash creates a shock in a medium radius around it.
* Upwards swings its' hammer, into a follow up attack of smashing it in the ground, and after a short delay a wide swing.
  * While armored: the swings are significantly faster and infused with electro.
* Charges rapidly towards the player, and upon reaching its' destionation, smashes the hammer into the ground.
  * Charges faster and the smash creates a shock in a medium radius around it.
