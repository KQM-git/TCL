* Stops in place and starts spraying around with its' gun around aiming at the player.
  * While armored: Walks forward towards the player.
* Leaps in the air for a great distance with the help of propulsion from its' cryo tubes, dealing damage on landing.
  * While armored: this attack is executed much faster.
* Charges up for a brief moment before belly slamming into the player.
