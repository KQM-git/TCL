* Shoots a projectile at the player
  * While armored: Shoots 2 additional projectiles in a wide angle to the left and right of the main one.
* Only while armored: Kneels down, sticking its' staff into the ground, summoning a great forcefield that will stop all projectiles from outside to strike itself and allies inside.
* Only while armored: Teleports a short distance away from the player.
