## Attacks

* Infues itself with a pyro armor, gaining great resistance and empowering certain attacks. The armor will have its' resistance against most elements increased, but has a great weakness to electro elemental application.
* Takes aim then starts charging up a pyro bullet at the player's location. The bullet will be shot at the location that was locked on at the start of the charge-up, not the current player location.
  * While armored: shoots 2 additional bullets after the first one.
* Leaps backwards to gain distance from the player.
  * While armored: takes a quick shot at the player after the leap.
