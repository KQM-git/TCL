# Treasure Hoarders: Marksman

Though they are called "marksmen," this name has an undercurrent of mockery to it, as they use crossbows instead of bows, which require a long period of training to use. It must be said that even hilichurls know how to operate a crossbow. Just point the wider end at the enemy, pull the trigger, and bam â€” that's all there is to it.
