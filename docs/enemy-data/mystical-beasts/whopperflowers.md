## Cryo whopperflower

These plants lurk under the surface and ambush unsuspecting prey. With the passage of years, sufficient nutrition, and the right environment, it could even take root somewhere and grow into a giant Cryo Regisvine...

## Attacks

* Sinks into the ground and emerges nearby.
* With a player in melee range of the Whopperflower, it may do a short animation spinning its' leaves and doing an AoE capable of hitting a maximum of three times.
* If a player is not in melee range, the Whopperflower will instead shoot out spikes from the ground that goes to the target.
* The Whopperflower will close its' leaves, consuming one of the "crystals" orbiting around it. When a "crystal" is finished, it will create a Cryo armor.
  The armor can be broken to prevent its' attack and stun it for ~15 seconds. If the armor is not broken for ~10 seconds, it will finish charging up its' attack.
  It will bend over, point its' top at the player, start spinning like a Gatling gun and shoot out a rapid volley of Cryo projectiles for a long period of time.
* Once all three "crystals" are consumed, the Whopperflower will plunge into the ground and restore all three, creating a visual AoE but will not do any DMG.

## Interactions

Whopperflowers will sometimes be found disguised as other flowers around the world.
The dormant whopperflower will not attack on its' own, but if the player picks up the fake flower it will awaken and begin combat.
Those fake flowers can be spotted easily as they:

1. Have no shining sparkle effect to them.
2. Do not appear white under the elemental vision effect.
3. Once in range to pick up, their icon left from the name text will be replaced with a chatting bubble.
