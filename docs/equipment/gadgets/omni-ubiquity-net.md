# Omni-Ubiquity Net

## Miscelaneous findings

* The Omni-Ubiquity Net (OUN) has a 1-animal-per-net limit.
* If more than one animal is in the OUN's aoe, the animal closest to the player is captured.
* Using the OUN near an animal will startle nearby animals, even if Sayu/Aloy are in the party, even if no animal is actually captured.
* The OUN does not seem to have a time limit on how long it can be held without capturing an animal (Additionally, you can rotate a full 360 degrees while holding it, but there is a maximum upper/lower angle that it can be aimed).
* The OUN can't be used in Domains or Abyss, like most other gadgets.
* The OUN can capture birds in midair if the player is quick enough.
* It's possible to capture frozen boars from Dragonspine without unfreezing them.
* The OUN can be used in another player's world, regardless of guest/host status.
* OUN has an estimated range of at least 23.46 meters.
