**Note: All findings are summarized. You can find detailed entries & credits to each finder in the evidence vault linked at the end of the page.**

## 5 Star Artifact Sets

### Archaic Petra

<Artifact artifact="Archaic Petra">

* The 4-Piece set bonus requires you to pick up the shard with the set holder.
* Shards generated by Geovishap Hatchings don't activate the the 4-Piece set bonus.
* The active bonus timer will end instantly when any piece is removed or when the holder leaves the party.

</Artifact>

### Blizzard Strayer

<Artifact artifact="Blizzard Strayer">

* The 4-Piece set bonus does not snapshot. The CRIT Rate increase is Dynamic, and changes your CRIT Rate in real time.
* The 4-Piece set bonus does not apply on the hit that applies Frozen.
* Enemies with the “Frozen” aura do not count as “being Frozen” for the 4-Piece set bonus. They need to be literally Frozen. Otherwise, it will be treated as just a Cryo aura, and you get only 20% CRIT Rate.
* Blizzard Strayer gives CRIT Rate buff to reactions that would remove the Cryo/Frozen from the enemy.

</Artifact>

### Bloodstained Chivalry

<Artifact artifact="Bloodstained Chivalry">

* The 4-Piece set bonus does not apply if a Co-op teammate, or an off-field character takes the kill.
* The 4-Piece set bonus is not lost when character is swapped out.
* The 4-Piece set bonus is not granted if the set holder gets a kill while off-field.
* You still require the minimum amount of stamina to perform a Charged Attack, your stamina just won't be reduced on execution.
* Stamina regen will continue even while performing Charged Attacks provided the buff is active allowing you to save stamina for dashing.
* The 4-Piece set bonus can be refreshed.
* The active bonus timer will end instantly when any piece is removed or when the holder leaves the party.

</Artifact>

### Crimson Witch of Flames

<Artifact artifact="Crimson Witch of Flames">

* Bonus Reaction damage is still applied even if the set holder is off-field. However, the set holder does need to trigger the Reaction.
* Gaining a stack refreshes the duration of previous stacks.
* Stacks are maintained after swapping characters.
* A stack is still gained even if the player is interrupted during Elemental Skill cast.
* Ending a continuous Hold Skill \([Sayu or Yelan hE](/docs/evidence/characters/anemo/sayu.md#sayu-release-of-hold-skill-counts-as-using-elemental-skill) as examples\) by tapping E is considered "Using an Elemental Skill" for the sake of the 4-Piece set bonus. Letting the Skill end naturally does not.  
* The active bonus timer will end instantly when any piece is removed or when the holder leaves the party.

</Artifact>

### Deepwood Memories

<Artifact artifact="Deepwood Memories">

* The active bonus timer will remain even when any piece is removed or the character equipping the set is swapped out of the team.

</Artifact>

### Desert Pavilion Chronicle

<Artifact artifact="Desert Pavilion Chronicle" />

### Echoes of an Offering

<Artifact artifact="Echoes of an Offering">

* The Flat DMG is not limited to single-target \(works in AoE\).
* It uses total ATK \(as expected\) including buffs from Bennett, 4-Piece Noblesse, and ATK from weapon passives.
* Hit registration occurs before evidence of it in the animation.
* The effect can be shared with subsequent attacks as long as they fit in the 0.05 second interval.
* Echoes will stack even when holder's Normal Attacks deal 0 damage.
* The 4-Piece effect triggers around 50.2% of the time *in theory assuming the set works exactly as written*.
* Trigger rate appears to fall off a little bit after 100-110 ping.  
* Further data that could point to the set working as intended but be subject to ping/possibly low FPS/character multi-hits quick enough to take advantage of the lag between server and client \(like Zhongli, or indicates that his spearkick is simply working differently compared to other multi-hits\).
* It can trigger the buff off-field, but does not gain stacks off-field.
* Ayato's second slash and first C6 strike seem to be linked. If the second slash is buffed by Echoes, the first C6 strike is also buffed. In turn, if the second slash is not buffed, the first strike will not be buffed either.
* Kazuha's 2-hit N3 is "not linked" but his 3-hit N5 is "linked". For more information see this [Vault Entry](../evidence/equipment/artifacts.md#kazuha-na-interaction-with-echoes).
* The set works weirdly with Tartaglia, for more information see this [Vault Entry](../evidence/equipment/artifacts.md#echoes-triggering-is-weird-and-inconsistent-for-tartaglia).
* How Tartaglia's N1 and N2 hits trigger Echoes differs depending on the tester. For more information see this [Vault Entry](../evidence/equipment/artifacts.md#tartaglias-n1-or-n2-procing-echoes-is-tester-dependent).
* How Yoimiya's N1 hits trigger Echoes differs depending on range.
* How Zhongli's spearkick hits trigger Echoes differs depending on the tester. For more information see this [Vault Entry](../evidence/equipment/artifacts.md#echoes-proc-on-zhongli-spearkick-attack-differs-between-tester).
* Zhongli's spearkick combos can fail to proc Echoes after 7, 8, or even 9 hits.
* For more testing results with Zhongli, see the following Vault Entries:
  * [Potade\#9775](../evidence/equipment/artifacts.md#more-zhongli-testing-data)
  * [Xreejan\#1180](../evidence/equipment/artifacts.md#more-zhongli-testing-data-at-160-ping)
  * [Latiwings\#3308](../evidence/equipment/artifacts.md#even-more-data-on-zhonglis-string-with-echoes)

### Ocean-Hued Clam

* Bennett's Elemental Burst does not proc the 4-Piece set bonus after the on-field character HP reaches 70%.
* The Sea-Dyed Foam bubble generated by the set bonus will disappear instantly when any piece is removed or when the holder leaves the party. No Bubble Damage if the bubble ends this way.

</Artifact>

### Retracing Bolide

<Artifact artifact="Retracing Bolide">

* The 4-Piece set has to be equipped to the character you want to buff, in most cases, your DPS character, not the character casting the shield.

</Artifact>

### Thundering Fury

<Artifact artifact="Thundering Fury">

* Damage boosts regarding reactions are additive with the multiplier from Elemental Mastery.
* 40% additional damage to Electro-related reactions is only applied if the set holder triggers the reaction. However, the set holder doesn't have to be active on-field.
* The 4-Piece set holder has to be active on-field to benefit from the cooldown reduction effect.
* Regarding how Electro-Charged works with 4TF, If the 4-Piece set bonus is not on cooldown \(0.8s\), then the set bonus is not hampered by Electro-Charged’s 1 second ICD. As long as you can keep constant Hydro aura on the enemy you can switch between different Elemental sources \(E1, E2, Electro-imbued autoattacks, and Q\) to obtain E CDR.
