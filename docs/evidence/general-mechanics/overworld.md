**Finding:**  
There are few piles of unique blue rocks in the Enkanomiya with interesting properties. They can be destroyed and represent unique blend of features native to other overworld objects.
The current known locations for these rocks:
* Inside small square building behind Vishap Research Lab (2 rocks) 
  *  [Map](https://imgur.com/a/WuQ1heh)   
  *  [View](https://imgur.com/a/7wtHwnu)  

**Evidence:**  
*Known Mechanics:*
* Blue rocks can be burned down [ShampooBrain\#9583](https://imgur.com/a/u4FXguH)
* Blue rocks do not respawn
   * Initial pile was found and destroyed on January 9, 2022
   * The pile at this location has not reappeared as of February 9, 2022: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/JrnmJTY)
* Blue rocks light up with Elemental Sight:  [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/qO1cijw)
* Blue rocks are targetable, examples:  
   * Oz [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/LwbzWQW)  
   * Guoba [ShampooBrain\#9583](https://imgur.com/a/X1585Zr)  
   * Diona [ShampooBrain\#9583](https://imgur.com/a/WTIh8Od)

   * [Freeze](https://imgur.com/a/KIo8sMI)  
   * [Shatter](https://youtu.be/J_fYyxo0Ltg)  

*Glitches:*  
* The hitbox of blue rocks seems to sink bow attacks directed at them at certain angles showing lack of hit animations or charge attack explosions.

   * test demonstrating arrow glitch affects long range attacks as well [Imgur](https://youtu.be/JDzvNCO6lP8)

**Significance:**   
* Furthering the knowledge of the cursed overworld of Teyvat. 
* Considering the island is called the Vishap Research Lab and the enclosure-like nature of the room, I can only surmise that Batyshmal Vishaps who were experimented on were kept in there at some point. The strange substance left behind on the ground is therefore most likely a reptile coprolite - the fossilized excrement of the Vishaps. The cobalt blue color is likely due to the elemental constitution of the beasts, and the crystal-like formation may be thanks to the uric acid that was present at the time of discharge. The easily flammable property further proves my point, since coprolite is mostly carbon. (Mr. Pillow\#0065)

*Glitches/Weird Stuff:*
* Spawning the teapot on top of the Rock makes it disappear: [Reens#9389](https://imgur.com/awZKod0)
* Rock behaves weird on ledges: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/9rJt9pa)
* Sometimes fall damage does not trigger on landing, and the rock will just disappear: [twentythree#3787](https://imgur.com/OC35oS1)

*Further Research:*
* It is currently not known if World Level affects rock HP or damage. This may change in the future.

**Significance:**  
The Rock (Igneous Pebblus) is a federally endangered species which is currently known to live in various regions of Mondstadt. The range of the Rock historically included the northern part of Dragonspine and various clusters in Cape Oath. Exploitative research and tree farming have driven this species to near extinction. It is unknown if there are surviving habitats of Rocks in other parts of Teyvat.

**Finding:**  
0-poise attacks also register on Kageroumaru.  

**Evidence:**  
[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/c8IpYrX.mp4) (notice the double hits)  

**Significance:**  
* Kageroumaru take hits like a chad.
* Helps to map out how XQ’s orbitals work.

**Finding:**  
Kageroumaru can hold non-elemental statuses, but not marks.

**Evidence:**  
* Xiangling C1+C2, Lisa Conductive stacks: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/eaTDcCd)

* Childe Riptide: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/a6pkRFJ)

(from ShampooBrain#9583)
* Qiqi Talisman: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/Dw6OGaT)
* Mona Bubble: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/tzRdWz1)

**Significance:**  
* Kageroumaru can not be affected by the elements.
* Categorisation of character-producing marked statuses:
  * First type is non status-affiliated mark (or simply mark). These marks so far are consistently referred to in-game by their names only, without mentioning the status effect. Examples include: Riptide, Blood Blossom, Fortune-Preserving Talisman, Aurous Blaze, etc.
  * Second type is status-affiliated mark (or simply status). These marks so far are consistently referred to in-game by their names, followed by the word “status”. Examples include: Implode status, “Decreased RES” status, Conductive status, etc.
Whether mHY keeps up with this consistency is unknown. Whether this is helpful to the general playerbase is unknown.
* Precursor to #marks-and-statuses, if mHY decides to add more of this trend, so more testing can be done.

**Finding:**  
1. Barrel damage is affected by the unit's defense, following the damage formula here: https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Defense. Attributes such as level, ascension, max hp have no effect on the amount of damage inflicted by barrel explosions.
2. Barrels do pyro damage, and is affected by reactions such as vaporize as well as pyro resist.
3. Damage Reduction such as Xingqiu rainsword orbitals can reduce explosion damage.
4. Explosive barrels have levels.
5. Barrel levels (probably) follow zone level rules.

**Evidence:** A series of suicide-by-barrel attempts have demonstrated the following findings:

Damage can be plotted against defense - [Image](https://imgur.com/ZTEWcff)

Inverse of damage, or effective hp (EHP), against defense: - [Image](https://imgur.com/nhw1sFu) 

Inverting barrel damage to EHP linearizes the trend, allowing a linear regression to be performed with the previous data points.

Explosive barrels have levels

The formula for EHP vs defense from linear regression EHP = 1.443e-07 * DEF + 1.277e-04 can be applied to figure out the base damage (damage done if the unit has 0 defense) as well as the level of the barrels, following the Genshin damage formula linked above.  

Base damage of the tested barrel is the inverse of the Y-intercept, or when DEF = 0. 1.277e-04^-1 = 7832.3563130198 or 7832 when rounded to a whole number.  

To figure out the level of the barrel:  
Incoming damage = Original damage * (1 - Damage reduction)  
Damage reduction = DEF / (DEF + 5*Level + 500)  

Incoming dmg → Inf means  
Incoming damage = Original damage * (1 - Damage reduction) → Inf  
which, given constant original damage translates as  
-Damage reduction → Inf, then  
Damage reduction = DEF / (DEF + 5*Level + 500) → -Inf  
And this is only possible if the denominator (DEF + 5 * Level + 500)→ 0⁻, given a constant def  

In practice, the negative value of the "x-intercept" (DEF when EHP approaches 0, or barrel damage approaches infinity) in the EHP vs DEF function is DEF + 5 * Level + 500. Since the x-intercept is -884 defense, the level of the barrel is 76.9, or 77 when rounded to whole number levels.  

Important note: This level only applies to the two tested barrels shown in the videos in evidence 1.

Barrel levels (probably) follow zone level rules.  
* [Zone levels](../../general-mechanics/overworld.md#zone-levels) 
* [Mondstadt zone map](https://imgur.com/E0oN0B6)

Two zones (dark blue, orange) were tested and the barrels within those zones all do the same amount of damage, given that the character's defense remains constant.   

The barrels tested in evidence a) agree with the zone level map (blue, levels 77 to 79).  

Enemies in the northern orange zone are between 82 and 90, and calculations with the evidence shows that those barrels are level 90 with base damage of 12176.

**Finding:** There are currently 214 (+1 or +2) respawnable investigation spots that drop artifacts. 

Pre 2.0:
* Liyue (pre 2.0) - 48 spots.
* Dragonspine - 7 spots.  

2.0:
* Liyue (added in 2.0) - 6 spots.
* Inazuma non-Tatarasuna - 24 spots.
* Tatarasuna - 24 spots.
* Bake-danukis - 11 spots.
* Cannons - 5 spots.
* Conch spots on the beach - either 1 or 2 spots - rng based.  

Patch 2.1 introduced 2 more islands. Each island has:
* Seirai island: 44 spots.
* Watatsumi island: 24 spots.
* Bake-danukis - 6 spots.    

Patch 2.2 introduced Tsurumi Island:
* Moshiri Kara: 1 spot (north of Tsurumi Island).
* Tsurumi Island: 14 spots.  

Maps:
* [Liyue + Dragonspine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcpie87/gi-artifacts/master/liyue.jpg)

**Finding:**  
Electro crystals have different damage values on the same world level, the recorded ones after defense are: 325, 267, 247, 279, 273, 297, 292, 303, 287, 283, the Lisa used for the test had 159 defense, meaning 15% damage reduction, further testing shows that there is no level differencial taken into the formula for crystal attacks, but they do have levels as indicated by reactions, the pre defense damage dealt by them is: 373, 307, 284, 320, 313, 341, 335, 348, 320, 325 repsectively to the values stated above, with the end results as:

| Electro Damage | Electro-Charged Damage | Calculated Crystal Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 325 | 1443 | 90 |
| 267 | 1135 | 80 |
| 247 | 1053 | 77 |
| 279 | 1189 | 82 |
| 273 | 1189 | 82 |
| 297 | 1307 | 86 |
| 292 | 1279 | 85 |
| 303 | 1337 | 87 |
| 287 | 1243 | 84 |
| 283 | 1216 | 83 |

The curious part is how 2 different crystal damages share the same level.

**Evidence:**

* [I went and got hit by every single electro crystal on the map with no stat change or effects to affect the damage taken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R738dkn2A4Q)  
* [the last 3 are in a different video that might as well be excluded as it provides nothing new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plkvuafVyKo)
* [Electro-charged testing result proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI7gNlhEmbg)

**Significance:**

**Theory:**  
Genshin's overworld works under a different set of reaction rules than the players, additionally supported by the entry [Overworld Entities Have Levels](../../evidence/general-mechanics/overworld.md#overworld-entities-have-levels), one of those different rules of reactions is Electrified water, when applying electro to water, it does not produce electro-charged, instead it infuses the water with electro for a few seconds, which does not apply electro, does not spread, and is not affected by 4TF set bonus, this electrified water can damage both the player and enemies. Water additionally is seen as friend to both player and enemy, which questions the nature of this Electrified reaction even further.

**Evidence:**  
Electrified water evidence, including 4TF attempts, enemy taking damage, as well as water never being a trigger to any reaction, only aura, as it's friendly to both parties: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuS2G0SUkHc)

**Significance:**  
There might be more reactions unknown to the player coded into the game's files for various reason, potentially to be used in the future or simply scrapped ideas that have not been remove

### Electrified Water Properties

**Finding:**  
The duration of the environmental elemental reaction Electrified Water has varying duration based on the gauge strength of electro applied. There are approximately 2 seconds between each tick. 1A of electro lasts for 3 ticks, 2B lasts for 5 ticks, and 4C lasts for 10 ticks.  
The damage dealt by Electrified water is affected by Electro Resistance. For example, a character with 15% Electro Resistance will take 85% of the Electrified Water damage.  

**Evidence:**  
Video contains Fischl and Lisa getting 3 ticks after applying 1A electro with charge attacks. Razor hold E and Beidou E get 5 ticks, and Beidou Q initial proc gets 10 ticks. The video also shows damage being reduced according to electro resistance obtained by the Protective Canopy Elemental Resonance. Finally, there is also footage of the monolith taking 248 damage from Electrified Water. The nearby slime (10% electro res) takes 223 damage from the same tick. Each tick reduces the monolith's health by about 1%. The monolith on Floor 2 of the Spiral Abyss will take damage from Electrified Water. Using Electrified Water, the monolith is found to have 0% electro resistance and approximately 24,800 HP: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aevZ6FPmcl4)  

**Significance:**  
Learning more about how environmental reactions are programmed/calculated. Also, don't bring electro units if you're trying to get the achievement for Floor 2-2 of the Spiral Abyss.

**Theory:**  
Genshin's water is coded in a way where the visual water and actual layer are separate, thus there is an invisible field of water that does not apply wet in random places of the world, but can be infused

**Evidence:**  
1. Invisible water being infused by Anemo MC: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR1zJjhqASI)

### Overworld Hydro Gauge and ICD  

**By:** BowlSoldier\#3528 and p.pineapple\#1129  
**Added:** 2021-11-05  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/ticket-archive/attachments_879642528046002176_903470522577326110_transcript-overworld-hydro-gauge-and-icd.html)  

**Finding:**  
Overworld Hydro can be split into 2 types:  
* Water (eg. seas, rivers, lakes, etc)  
  * ICD = 0.25s
  * Strength = 10 durability per tick, stacks up to a max of 50
  * Duration = 8s, regardless of durability  
* Rain (unknown whether normal rain and thunderstorm rain work the same)  
  * ICD = 0.5s
  * Strength = 10 durability per tick, stacks up to a max of 30
  * Duration = Unknown, could not manage to test 

**Evidence:**  
[Water ICD and per-tick strength](https://youtu.be/x2yf3COJR0M): Ticks happened every 0.25s. Number of ticks indicates that each tick was 10 durability.  

[Water Duration](https://youtu.be/f2j6qEDQSl8): Hydro aura disappears 8 seconds after leaving the water.  

[Water Max Strength, and Stacking](https://youtu.be/r7W9h75ct2U):  
* The duration the Hillichurl was frozen for indicates they had 48-50 durability
* They were re-frozen 43 frames after falling into the water. Since water ticks every 15 frames, they should have had 3 ticks applied to them for 30 durability. * Their frozen duration matches 28-30 durability

Rain Max Strength:  
* Tested by freezing with both 25 and 50 Cryo, then comparing the duration to the Freeze duration formula
* Freeze duration formula: t = 24 * ( 5^0.5 * ((x) + 20)^0.5 - 10 )
* Where t is the freeze duration in frames, and x is the freeze aura durability, which is 2x the minimum of the Cryo and Hydro gauges.
  * [25 Cryo test](https://youtu.be/xnmioJca29g): Lasted 210 frames. This is the number for min(25, Hydro) = 25, so Hydro durability is at least 25
  * [50 Cryo test](https://youtu.be/Lw2wvGbpY-0): Lasted 240 frames. This is the number for min(50, Hydro) = 30, so Hydro durability is 30

[Rain ICD and Per-tick Strength](https://youtu.be/Kjx3EFqfdrE): The reductions in the Pyro shield happened every 30 frames, or 0.5s. The number of ticks it took to remove the Pyro shield indicates 10 durability per tick. The first reduction was 30 durability's worth, since the mage already had fully stacked rain on them when they applied their shield.  

**Significance:**  
Better understanding of how overworld hydro works for aura and reaction testing.

**Finding:**  
Waterfalls are inconsistent.  

1. Most waterfalls apply the Wet status if you climb on the sides, but on occasion this won't happen. For most waterfalls, you only get the Wet status if you're climbing on either side of them, and not any other part. Gliding, falling, or walking onto the side will not apply the Wet status.  
2. a. Most waterfalls do not apply the Wet status if you drop down or climb in the middle, but there are waterfalls that do.  
   b. There are platforms in waterfalls that can be landed/climbed onto. Some of these platforms will apply the Wet status, others will not. It's not always consistent even in the same waterfall. 
3. If you climb up the middle part of the waterfall, you will get the Wet status, although this does not happen in certain waterfalls and parts of other waterfalls.  
4. The edge of the waterfall between the water on the top and the actual falling water does not apply the Wet status when standing or swimming in it.

### Frozen Water Sans Water Is Unfreezable, Unmeltable, Etc.

**By:** Aevean Leeow\#1362  
**Added:** 2022-08-23  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/frozen-water-sans-water-is-unfreezable-unmeltable-etc)  

**Finding:**  
Frozen water can be isolated from regular water by changing the water level or position after freezing the water. The patch of ice will be stationary, and you may stand on it or place constructs on it, just like the regular behaviour. It will also expire at the expected time for regular frozen water. This is similar behaviour to Electro-Charged patches of water, which will also remain in place regardless of the water movement, and will behave as expected.

This ticket uses an area in Mona's GAA quest domain. Do note that the water level does continuously change between the 3 possible ending states, so you can Freeze or Electro-Charge water inbetween the "3 levels," but for ease of TC most of the tests were done at the top or middle level.

Note that there are visual bugs where the part of or the entire ice graphic may disappear prematurely. It is unknown whether this is because of the graphics settings I used, the mechanics of the water level changer, or an issue with frozen water without regular water. This is entirely visual and the invisible ice functions the exact same.

However, frozen water is inert and will not be affected by Elemental applications or abilities. This is in contrast to regular frozen water, which has numerous interactions with Elemental applications.

* Pyro: will not melt the ice.
* Cryo: will not extend the duration of Freeze.
* Electro: will not produce a Superconduct effect.
* Anemo: no Swirl, but regular frozen water with water will not Swirl either.
* Absorption: cannot absorb Cryo.
* Geo: no Crystallize, but regular frozen water with water will not Crystallize either.
* Hydro: will not extend the duration of Freeze. No effect on regular frozen water with water either, this is just to prove that there is no interaction with a hypothetical Cryo aura on the frozen water.  

One theory I had was that the water itself holds the Cryo aura, rather than the physical manifestation of the frozen water. However, an Elemental application to the corresponding displaced water does not behave as if there is any cryo aura (no SC on Electro application), which does not support this conclusion.

**Significance:**  
Bravo, MiYoHo. On the surface, this seems to be a relatively innocuous mechanic that has little impact on gameplay or balance. However, this is actually a brilliant mechanic that increases game depth and the skill ceiling of Genshin Impact. Consider some alternate methods to implement the frozen water mechanic:  
  
One option is to make things "logical," for frozen water to simply disappear when the water level moves, or to move with the water itself. There is nothing inherently bad about this approach, but it has little effect on gameplay, and the game will have less depth as a result. Allowing Cryo units to obtain the high ground, unlike other Elements, increases the variety and diversity in Genshin Impact. Consider the alternative. If every Element had the same capabilities, then the game would be much less interesting. Thus, the "logical" approach is undesirable.  

### Electro Crystal Range

**Finding:** Electro crystals' pulse range works in a rectangle range, with the crystal being not centered, but rather between the center and the side

**Evidence:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8QfbYvuR6Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8QfbYvuR6Q)

**Significance:** electro crystals work in a similar way to cryo&pyro stamen flowers, for a better understanding of the overworld.

### Parametric Crystal Electric Bungaloo

**Findings:**  
* An electric crystal can have its aura removed, but it will be reapplied.
* When it's raining, you can apply Hydro aura using 2B Cryo (Kaeya) then end rain (by time skipping) and the crystal will not apply Electro to itself again. It has to be 2B, 1A won’t work.
* So far the crystal can hold Cryo, Hydro, and Electro. 
* Rain water Hydro is different from regular Hydro, and the game doesn’t recognize it as the same as Hydro from different sources (Such as player Hydro and Hydro from bodies of water). This is proved as the crystal doesn’t update and reapply Electro onto itself as it thinks no element was applied onto it, removing the Electro. Game does not recognize rain Hydro, as other sources of Hydro.

**Significance:**  
Rain Hydro isn’t the same as other Hydro sources. Electro crystals don’t have infinite aura, it just constantly reapplies Electro aura, it’s more then 1A, but less then 2B.

### Overworld Entities Have Levels

**Finding:**  
Overworld has levels for every "body", including water and grass and sand, trees, rocks, and other things that we can't prove in any other way other than the game's code which shows this, thus varying stats which is proven by their damage.

**Evidence:**  
Flower stamens deal damage based on a static, pre-determined level assigned to them. While levels for grass are dynamic and change under currently unknown circumstances: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NlTEDO2oFk)  
Water (using electrified): [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSepgh_2M_M)  

**Signifiance:**

### Genshin has 2D Water

**Finding:**  
Genshin's water exists only in horizontal, 2 dimensional sheets. Additionally, true water is not graphically represented at all times, while graphically represented water is only an approximation.

**Evidence:**  
[Album](https://imgur.com/a/j0b5Y5a)  
1 shows Jean standing in waterfall without getting wet.  
2 shows venti climbing into waterfall below the 2d plane of "true water" without getting wet, but getting wet when he climbs into it at a slightly higher angle. When Venti then falls through the waterfall, he remains dry the entire time before impacting the second 2D plane of water.  
Greyhound's videos demonstrate that such planes appear to have water properties from below (Clip 3), and that its edges in some cases look to be perfectly square (Clip  4). Razor illustrates the trouble with this in Clip 5 by electrocharging the "true water" hidden below a dry floor and hurting himself with the resulting electrocharge AoE.

**Significance:**  
Electro is awful for the overworld because you can electrocharge water which resides in a flat sheet invisibly below the ground with AoE attacks. By doing this, you take continuous damage while standing on a dry surface. Also, you can stand in waterfalls without getting wet.

### Environment Reactions Base

**Theory:**  
Environment uses a different set of reaction bases than players, thanks to the EM buffs and my prior testing of electro crystal levels, we can conclude that although the value at release was the same as for the player, now it's different, with the player having a new one, and the electro crystals using the old, unchanged base.

**Evidence:**  
The video shows a level 84 electro-charged tick of the pre 1.6 base (1243)

**Significance:**  
We're getting ever so closer to figuring out the cursed world of teyvat's code

## Campfires act like 1U of Pyro Aura

**Finding:**  
Lit campfires essentially have a 1U aura of pyro that don't decay over time.

Consuming the campfire aura requires one of the following:
* One 1U application of Hydro or Electro
* Two 1U applications of Cryo, Anemo, or Geo
* One 2U (or higher) application of Cryo, Anemo, or Geo

The aura on the campfire is 1U, regardless of the Pyro aura applied.  
For example, Bennett's tap E, which applies 2U of Pyro, still creates a campfire that behaves the exact same as one lit with 1U of pyro.  

**Evidence:**

The no level area (Mondstadt bridge) does not have any value marked in the game code. Burned grass and electrified water do damage, but the damage is depending on the previous zone level you have been in. In other words, that area's level is dynamic and fully dependent on your position on the map before entering it. - [Video example of the no level area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj3ROEgPc84)

**Finding:**  
Zone level damage is relative to the player's position rather than the location of whatever is taking damage.

**Evidence:**   
The burning damage changes as the player enters and exists different zone levels.

**Theory:**  
Elemental applications can be used to destroy and damage bushes, however not all elements are equal in this regard. Additionally, there are several other abilities such as Jean's E, the cast of Kaeya's burst, Albedo's burst, etc... which can be used to both damage and destroy bushes.

**Theory:** Genshin remembers your location and world state(such as bosses) in different map tabs separately.  

**Evidence:** Anemo hypostasis and other world bosses normally respawn after 3 minutes and teleporting away&back (as shown at the end), but doesn't respawn after going to the Archipelago, additionally teapot shows that it remembers your ogriginal location in Teyvat upon leaving: [Video](https://youtu.be/oeCJF5fXqqMkqm)  

**Significance:** It'll be relevant whenever more overworld mechanics are added which refresh when tping in/out or if we get more map tabs.  

## Coordinates

### Coordinates translation methods  

**By:** Mcpie\#8672  
**Added:** 2021-07-21  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/ticket-archive/attachments_865345502047764490_867159298671640616_transcript-coordinates-translation-methods.html)  

**Theory:** Coordinates translation methods from in-game coordinates into official teyvat map and vice versa.  
[Official Teyvat Interactive Map](https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html)  

Translation snippet:  
If you open feedback url and paste the snippet below into the console, it will give you your current coordinates as you would see them on center parameter url in interactive map.  
```javascript
coords = JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent((new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('ext'))).loc;
f1 = ((x, y, z) => [-x + 2329.9357585906982, -z - 749.9086303710938]);
f1(coords.x, coords.y, coords.z);
```

Here is the reversal snippet, which assumes that you're on the interactive map and you want to get the coordinates in game of your current visible center:  
```javascript
coords = String(window.location).split('&').find(e => e.match(/^center=(.*)$/)).split('=')[1].split(',').map(e => +e);
f2 = ((x, y) => [-x + 2329.9357585906982, 200, -y - 749.9086303710938]);
f2(...coords);
```

NOTE: (calculations were done in patch 1.6)

**Evidence:** Official map url (query parameters) contain two variables: `center` and `zoom`. `zoom` does not matter at all in calculations because the translation function applies a vector, therefore there is no scaling and everything is 1-1 with a manipulated OX and OY axises directions.  

**IMPORTANT:**  
The format from `center`, which is `center=x,y` is reversed in the database, so if you were to look into requests and something seems off - that's because each coordinate is stored in the system with attributes `x_pos` and `y_pos`. If we had to translate it directly into the url, it would be `center=${y_pos},${x_pos}`.  
From now on, I am assuming a format `center=x,y` is a correct one, because it's easier to manipulate for common folks.  

Method used to get translation vector:  
1. Find `(0,0)` in game - use feedback url and go north/east/west/south and compare it against previous coordinates.  
2. Once `(0,0)` is found, create a new pin here.  
3. Go to Official Teyvat Map and synchronize your in-game pins. You might need to wait few minutes/hours before it's properly synced - try refreshing the page.  
4. While still on the page, open the console and start tracking network requests. You're looking for `https://api-os-takumi.mihoyo.com/common/map_user/ys_obc/v1/map/spot/get_map_spots_by_kinds`  
5. Toggle visible pins from the same category as the one you placed in game. Request should respond with a list of pins. Each pin has x_pos and y_pos attribute.  
Example pin: `{ x_pos: 585.788330078125, y_pos: -362.876220703125 }`  
However, as stated above - this is reversed in center parameter in the url for unknown to me reason. Keep that in mind.  
6. If you managed to find the pin you created, it should have values `{ x_pos: 749.9086303710938), y_pos: 2329.9357585906982 }` - this represents the translation vector.

Screenshot from this pin: [https://i.imgur.com/ym4TOvB.png](https://i.imgur.com/ym4TOvB.png)

Method used to figure out directions:  
1. Note coordinates  
2. Go strictly east and note coordinates again. Only one of them should change.  
3. Go strictly north this time and note coordinates again. Only one of them should change compared to the ones from step 2.  
4. Perform the same action but for interactive map. Now play around with coordinates and decide whether you need to multiply scalar by (-1) or not in translation function.  
5. In our case, in-game -> interactive map requires (-1) on both scalars.  
Image representing coordinate axises (assumes `center=x,y` format):  
[https://i.imgur.com/rEy06Mq.png](https://i.imgur.com/rEy06Mq.png)

Method used to get in-game -> interactive map scale:  
1. Place 2 pins rather far away from each other (in order to reduce the error).  
2. Go to first pin -> feedback url and extract the coordinates.  
3. Repeat for second pin.  
4. Now do the same, but by extracting direct coordinates from network tracking on interactive map.  
The differences on respective axises should be the same. Remember that coordinates from the database are reversed.  
Now that we figured out the translation vector, scale and direction of target, we can create a translation from in-game coordinate system to interactive map coordinates system.  

If you open feedback url and paste this snippet into the console, it will give you your current coordinates as you would see them on center parameter in interactive map.  
```javascript
coords = JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent((new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('ext'))).loc;
f1 = ((x, y, z) => [-x + 2329.9357585906982, -z - 749.9086303710938]);
f1(coords.x, coords.y, coords.z);
```

Since `1: R^3 -> R^2` then one variable (altitude) is completely lost, hence the reversal is impossible with altitude variable restored.

Here is the reversal snippet, which assumes that you're on the interactive map and you want to get the coordinates in game of your current visible center:  
```javascript
coords = String(window.location).split('&').find(e => e.match(/^center=(.*)$/)).split('=')[1].split(',').map(e => +e);
f2 = ((x, y) => [-x + 2329.9357585906982, 200, -y - 749.9086303710938]);
f2(...coords);
```

As a confirmation, you can run this snippet on any coordinate you would like.  
```javascript
coords = [100, 200, 300]
f1 = ((x, y, z) => [-x + 2329.9357585906982, -z - 749.9086303710938]);
f2 = ((x, y) => [-x + 2329.9357585906982, 200, -y - 749.9086303710938]);
result = f2(...f1(...coords))
```

due to IEEE 754, the result will be off at epsilon level.

**Significance:** Easier navigation at finding in-game and official teyvat map coordinates.

### Coordinates Units Descriptions

**Added:** 2021-08-09

**Finding:**  
In-game (x,y,z) and Official Teyvat Map (x,y) coordinates system description:
`1 = 1m` - visible for example when you're navigating towards commission.  
`1.68 = 1px` - at max zoom out and 1920x1080 resolution.  
`0.42 = 1px` - at max zoom in and 1920x1080 resolution.  
[Official map](https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html)

**Evidence:**  
1. 1 unit represents 1 meter in-game  
Three coordinates, extracted through feedback url.  

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/woXSkC3.jpg)

Calculations:  
```javascript
1: Object { x: 608.6038208007812, y: 228.3050537109375, z: 1754.6199951171875 }, distance: 3172m
2: Object { x: 2189.55419921875, y: 207.5247802734375, z: -1075.6280517578125 }, distance: 84m
3: Object { x: 2040.2203369140625, y: 215.52943420410156, z: -1077.7127685546875 }, distance: 83m
```

Let's try to find `(x,y,z)` meeting the criteria.  
```javascript
((x-608.6038208007812)^2 + (y-228.3050537109375)^2 + (z-1754.6199951171875)^2= 3172^2) and
((x-2189.55419921875)^2 + (y-207.5247802734375)^2 + (z+1075.6280517578125)^2= 84^2) and
((x-2040.2203369140625)^2 + (y-215.52943420410156)^2 + (z+1077.7127685546875)^2= 83^2)
```

After solving, Noelle is at around `{ x: 2113, y: 210.71, z: -1037.51 }`  
Distance between 1st coordinate and Noelle:  
`((608.6038208007812 - 2113)**2 + (228.3050537109375 - 210.71)**2 + (1754.6199951171875 - (-1037.51))**2)**(1/2) = 3171.6726438170454`  
Due to possible error in displaying meters in-game (rounding up), this seems accurate.

Let's compare the real coordinates. We're taking first coordinate with distance of 3172m  
Noelle estimated coordinates from in-game (hard to get without ~1m error):  
`{ x: 2113.30712890625, y: 206.05450439453125, z: -1038.918212890625 }`

Coordinates difference:  
```javascript
[608.6038208007812 - 2113.30712890625, 228.3050537109375 - 206.05450439453125, 1754.6199951171875 - (-1038.918212890625)]
[ -1504.7033081054688, 22.25054931640625, 2793.5382080078125 ]
```

After measuring the vector length:  
```javascript
(1504.7033081054688**2 + 22.25054931640625**2 + 2793.5382080078125**2)**(1/2) = 3173.0872745589463
```

So our own calculations yielded `3172m`, while estimated real distance was `3173m`.  
Therefore, 1 unit in-game represents 1 meter in game.

2. 1px represents 1.68 units at max zoom out and 1920x1080 resolution.  
Since we know that translation from in-game coordinates to interactive map system does not use scaling, we can use interactive map coordinates system.  
We assume format `center=x,y` and we're using interactive map system. Remember that error of <30 is possible for each coordinate.  

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/QWv8PSL.png)  
```javascript
pos1 = (-580, 877)
pos2 = (256, -713)
|pos1_x - pos2_x| = |-580 -    256| =  836
|pos1_y - pos2_y| = | 877 - (-713)| = 1590
```

Since we know that x represents vertical axis and y is horizontal axis, the difference is 1590 units in width and 836 units in height.

I'm taking a picture from pos1 to pos2 at max zoom out using 1920x1080 resolution on PC.
width: 937, height: 498  
In order to verify that ratio is saved, we'll compare coord ratio vs image size ratio.  
```javascript
coord_ratio = 1590.0 / 836.0
> 1.9019138755980862
image_ratio = 937.0 / 498.0
> 1.8815261044176708
```

ratio is within acceptable error, let's compare the scale by dividing coordinates both width and height difference by image width and height  
```javascript
1590.0 / 937.0
> 1.696905016008538
836.0 / 498
> 1.678714859437751
```

So this would mean that 1 px is equal to around ~1.68 in-game units assuming 1920x1080 and max zoom out.

1504px in height and 2792px in width.

However, I'm playing on 1920x1080 and I can clearly see it on the screen, so the theory that 1px = 1m might hold true, but not for all resolutions or it might be dependant on zoom level.  

3. 1px represents 0.42 units at max zoom in and 1920x1080 resolution.  
How much is 1 pixel equal to at 1080p and max zoom in?  
Same process as with max zoom out.  

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/K9Md0pu.png)  
```javascript
pos1 = (-580, 877)
pos3 = (-363, 586)
|pos1_x - pos3_x| = |-580 - (-363)| = 217
|pos1_y - pos3_y| = | 877 -    586| = 291
```

That's 291 units in width and 217 units in height.  
Let's take a screenshot at max zoom in using 1920x1080 resolution.  
Dimensions are:  
width: 685  
height: 512  
Let's compare the ratios to be sure  
```javascript
coord_ratio = 291.0 / 217.0
> 1.3410138248847927
image_ratio = 685.0 / 512.0
> 1.337890625
```

ratio is within acceptable error, let's compare the scale by dividing coordinates both width and height difference by image width and height  
```javascript
291.0 / 685.0
> 0.4248175182481752
217.0 / 512.0
> 0.423828125
```

So this would mean that 1 px is equal to around ~0.424 in-game units assuming 1920x1080 and max zoom in.

**Significance:**  
Estimating distance between points is now easier due to known values in different systems.

### Extracting coordinates while in game

**Theory:**  
It's possible to extract your current coordinates through feedback url.

**Evidence:**  
Go to Paimon Menu -> Feedback. They're stored in the generated url. Under query value called `ext`.  
```javascript
ext=%7b%22loc%22%3a%7b%22x%22%3a713.8189697265625%2c%22y%22%3a120.84298706054688%2c%22z%22%3a275.4739074707031%7d%2c%22platform%22%3a%22WinST%22%7d
```
Running `decodeURIComponent` on this value will yield a valid JSON.  
See attached image on how to decode it in vanillaJS.

VanillaJS snippet that will extract this value in console:  
```javascript
JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent((new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('ext'))).loc
```

The result for example case will look like this:  
```javascript
Object { x: 713.8189697265625, y: 120.84298706054688, z: 275.4739074707031 }
```

**Significance:**  
This provides an easy way to calculate the distance between two points in game.

4. Perform the same action but for interactive map. Now play around with coordinates and decide whether you need to multiply scalar by (-1) or not in translation function.  
5. In our case, in-game -> interactive map requires (-1) on both scalars.

If someone is going to rely on in-game coordinates from feedback url, they might get lost thinking they're going in wrong direction while navigating through interactive map.

### Coordinates change when idle

**Finding:**  
Character coordinates change whenever game state is not frozen (unpaused single player).

**Evidence:**  
Steps to reproduce:  
1. Extract coordinates  
2. Go back to Genshin Impact  
3. Unpause and pause the game (do not move)  
4. Extract coordinates  

The coordinates will be different.

In my case, `ext` query values were:  
```javascript

second="%7b%22loc%22%3a%7b%22x%22%3a713.8189697265625%2c%22y%22%3a120.84298706054688%2c%22z%22%3a275.4739074707031%7d%2c%22platform%22%3a%22WinST%22%7d"
```
Running `decodeURIComponent` on both of them yields:

Which upon closer inspection, differ at 3rd decimal value in x and z axis. Lower difference on y means that y coordinate is responsible for height.

**Significance:**  
Fluff. This could also explain the fact that when you switch from child to adult male, your camera "target" goes up because the head is higher by ~0.4m.

**Findings:**  
A) When all party members' health reaches 0, the revive screen comes up and 2 things happen:  
* You are respawned at the nearest Teleport Waypoint, Statue of the Seven or Domain, relative to where the last member died.
* All party members are healed to 35% of their max HP (rounded off to the nearest whole number).  

B) There are 2 kinds of environmental deaths:  
* Drowning and falling into the void takes away a set 10% of all party members' max HP.
* Other environmental deaths tie in with Finding A

C) Health is "dynamic" and restored as "% of max HP" instead of a flat amount.

**Evidence:**  
Teleported to the Nearest Waypoint:  
* [Nearest Domain](https://youtu.be/Kktd971hhGA)
* [Nearest Statue of the Seven](https://youtu.be/sn0KKSx1D84)

Other environmental deaths:  
* [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/r6fPD71)

Health is dynamic:  
To start, Bennett had 281/10,987 HP (2.56%) and Fischl had 190/8,144 HP (2.33%). Bennett had 10,987 HP at the moment of death. After he died, flowers were equipped on both characters, raising Bennett's Max HP to 15,767 and Fischl's to 12,924. After equipping the flower, Fischl's HP changed from 190/8,144 to 301/12,924, staying at 2.33% of her max HP. Fischl dies with 12,924 Max HP. The revive screen comes up, and they are both respawned and healed. Bennett is revived with 5,518/15,767 HP, which is 35% of his new max HP. Fischl is revived with 4,523/12,924 HP, at 35%. After unequipping both flowers, Bennett's HP changed to 3,845/10,987, which is still 35% of his max HP while Fischl's HP changed to 2,850/8144, staying at 35% of her max HP.

**Finding:**  
Not all 2U pyro attack ignite grass.  

We already know applying 2U pyro on grass can light them on fire with single hit, but for unknown reason some 2U pyro attacks do not apply pyro on grass.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
Applying pyro on grass is not a foolproof method for testing elemental gauge since not all attacks apply element to environment.

## Chests

### Treasure Compass Chest Rendering

**By:** Tibo\#4309  
**Added:** 2021-10-17  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/ticket-archive/attachments_894036451740766218_899191434735943730_transcript-treasure-compass-range-chest-rendering.html)  

**Finding:**  
* Treasure Compass detection depends on chest rendering, chest rendering suffers from an It Depends™.
* Chest rendering seems to be square, off-set from chest, 360m x 360m for some while 180m x 180m for others.

**Evidence:**  
Testing:  
- To reduce variance in coordinates, the same character (Kazuha) is being used when checking coordinates. Smaller characters have lower coordinates.  
Repeat the following until some samples in each cardinal direction/some in same cardinal direction on different ends
- If chest in view: find border where chest becomes invisible, take screenshot before the chest becomes visible and open feedback menu. Move closer until it does, repeat screenshot/feedback menu.
- If chest not in view: while slowly moving inwards, repeatedly screenshot/feedback until you find the border - use last two feedback tabs/screenshots for last out/in coordinates.

Tested chests:  
- Chest 1 (Common): [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vlH5Ka3.png) (chest unlocks after defeating monsters)  
- Chest 2 (Luxurious): [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sjfQMuA.png) (chest appears after lighting electro structures)  
- Chest 3 (Common): [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kpmvMrE.png) (chest appears after completing time trial)  
- Chest 4 (Precious): [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/P31H4JI.png) (chest unlocks after defeating monsters)  

Chest 1:  
- Range doesn't seem to be square centered around chest
- Not circular: seen from two testing points on the north side
- Seems to be in range at around (+- a couple meters) 166m north, 191m east, 193m south and 172m west

Chest 2 (only south range tested):  
- Chest is on top of some Hilichurl structure and disappears with said structure after 97m south

Chest 3 (only north range tested):  
- Disappears after ~90.5m north

Chest 4 (unable to easily test south):  
- Chest is visible around 178m north, 195m east and ~165m west

Since 1 & 4's north+south and east+west add up to ~360, it seems that it's a square but not centered around the chest itself

In some screenshots, the compass points towards another chest when the tested chest is out of range, but will still point towards the tested chest in range. This is due to the compass picking the closest chest in euclidean distance while rendering isn't a circle/sphere, but a square

Maps:

- Map make stuff: [Git](https://gist.github.com/Tibowl/0529a89f9f9a2b35235a37fc36687a8a)

Summary:  
- Treasure Compass detection depends on chest rendering
- Chest rendering is square, but not centered around chest
- Chests that unlock render for ~180m (360x360 square)
- Chests that appear render for ~90m (180x180 square) (assumed to be similar with just lower range to other chests)
- Rarity doesn't affect range
- Compass points towards closest chest in euclidean distance

**Significance:**  
Using the Treasure Compass to play ChestColle

## Torch Lighting with Zero Gauge Pyro Hits

**Finding:**  
Some overworld objects (torches, mist flowers) interact with 0 gauge pyro hits (hits that don't apply pyro aura to enemies).  

**Evidence:**  
Overload and Torches:  
- [Overload lighting a torch but not applying pyro to hilichurl](https://youtu.be/tyuLDjja0cQ)

**Finding:**  
Interactions with the Thunder Fog in The Thundering Wilds daily commission.  
1. Sucrose's N1, N2, and N3 don't work on their own.
2. Sucrose's N1 and N2 work when there is something next to it that she can target, so it's assumed that N3 is the same way, but no one has been able to actually do it yet.
3. Every other Anemo ability works on its own.
4. The attacks from Anemo Slimes don't work, some examples of things that Sucrose can't target (and can't disperse the fog with) are the Portable Waypoint, Serenitea Pot, and Windblume Festival Commemorative Balloon.

**Evidence:**   
1. Sucrose N1 and N2 not working: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/B5jLUybrFtM)

## Boat Mechanics Addendum

**Added:** 2022-01-14  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/ticket-archive/attachments_921392473757069312_931429201175793674_transcript-boat-mechanics-addendum.html)

**Findings:**  
General:  
* Waverider level is determined by world level.
* The Waverider has 0 def and 0 elemental resistances.
* Waverider heals 0.65% when the player is outside of it, and 5% when inside and not in combat. Percentages are in terms of waverider max HP.

Waverider-Terrain interactions:
* When the waverider is in water that is too shallow for it, it slowly drifts towards deeper water.
* When you try to go over a waterfall, you either get stuck if the water is too shallow... or the boat deconstructs.

Waverider vs environment:
* Waverider can be hit by lightning (possibly only in shallow water)
* Waverider takes EC damage if player is in the boat.
* Waverider takes damage from the environment, such as electro crystals and cryo mistflowers. The player needs to be in the boat.
* Waverider is not affected by balethunder or "spicy water".

Waverider vs player:
* Waverider cannot be CC'd with Anemo attacks such as Jean's or Venti's E.
* Waverider can be slightly shifted with Geo MC's E.
* You cannot raise the boat with Albedo E.
* You cannot place Zhongli Steles near the boat.
* There's a zone around the waverider where the water can't be frozen.
* If you use the waverider TP to summon the waverider when the "destination" is frozen, it deconstructs

Misc:
* Waverider is not affected by Corrosion. If a character is affected by corrosion and enters the boat, HP does not continue to decay, but the duration of the corrosion effect still ticks.

## Stuff Can Infuse Cryo

**Added:** 2022-01-21  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/ticket-archive/attachments_918031384122114048_934045834268532736_transcript-stuff-can-infuse-cryo.html)

**Finding:**  
The Cryo element is able to be applied to many overworld objects, such as ores and animals. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that some overworld objects can hold Cryo without said Cryo being visible through elemental sight.

**Evidence:**   
Sheet documenting which objects can and cannot be infused with Cryo: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eDkENLmA9Fk7IJv3VSJ1H4LC5KDUcYfd-Y0WNd2s0kA/edit?usp=sharing)   
It should be noted that some objects simply cannot be tested as they are destroyed even due to zero damage attacks, such as Ayaka's special sprint (an example being the Liyue screens in domains).

**Significance:**  
Largely fluff. However, the application of cryo does mean that some elemental reactions can be performed on inanimate objects which can come with some side benefits. An example of this is that shatter can be trigged on rocks via this method, turning normally slow characters for mining into slightly more acceptable (such as Albedo).

**Finding:**  
Activated Phase Gates don't need to be visually present to allow travelers to phase through and travel to the opposite gate. This condition can be observed during a commission.  

**Evidence:**  
* [Video 1](https://imgur.com/BXO7oqP)

 **Finding:**  
 The Spoutrocks introduced into the overworld with Chasm in patch 2.6, let you land your jump without taking fall damage regardless of height difference\(\+/\-\), as long as you don't:  
* Glide 
* Roll off a cliff \(counts as landing, you don't take damagedmg for roll but the next landing won't be soft\) 
* Use mid\-air skills e.g. Xiao
* Plunge \(normal reduced fall dmg for plunge, capped at 40% max HP\)

Side-on collisions while jumping don't hurt and don't remove the fall damage reduction.  

**Evidence:**  
[Video clips](https://youtu.be/7zwe-kSpQ7M) of jumps from spoutrocks showing:
* No DMG landing
* Side\-on collision then landing with no DMG.
* Freezing and unfreezing mid\-air then landing with no DMG.
* Death by fall DMG after glide canceling a spoutrock jump.
* Death by fall DMG on second landing after rolling for the first.
* Death by fall DMG after skill canceling a spoutrock jump.
* Normal plunging fall DMG after plunge canceling a spoutrock jump.

**Significance:**  
Relax and enjoy the ride, it's often safer and faster than plunging if you want to get down on the ground.

**Finding:**  
Highest Places in Teyvat

**Evidence:**  
A comprehensive guide to the highest places in each region/map, extracted using [Extracting coordinates while in-game](#extracting-coordinates-while-in-game). The exact values might differ due to [Coordinates change when idle](#coordinates-change-when-idle). For reference, sea level is 200 meters in Teyvat, and Mt. Everest is 8,848.86 meters.

From lowest highest place to highest highest place, the order is: 

- Highest Place in Liyue: Qinguyn Peak Cloud Dwelling: 551.7357788085938 meters.   
Coordinates from [this point](https://imgur.com/a/jvtuwkT)

- Highest Place in Inazuma: Serai Island Thunder Manifestation Arena: 558.1334838867188 meters.  
Coordinates from [this point](https://imgur.com/a/IN2N97j)

- Highest Place in Mondstadt (Considering Dragonspine a part of Mondstadt): Dragonspine Skyfrost Nail: 697.6060180664062 meters.  
Coordinates from [this point](https://imgur.com/a/ZSKhC20)

- Highest Place in the Chasm Underground: Ad Hoc Main tunnel out of bounds: 1487.64208984375 meters.  
Coordinates from [this point](https://imgur.com/a/tMOz67z)

- Highest Place in Enkanomiya: Mirror Library: 1941.7440185546875 meters.  
Coordinates from [this point](https://imgur.com/a/gl7Cfil)  
Note: It is possible to get a few meters higher by glitching out of the library and climbing to the top, I was unable to do so.

Just from base of map to highest point possible in the map, Enkanomiya is the clear winner. However, as it is underground, the Dragonspine Skyfrost Nail is technically the highest place in Teyvat. With Earth's gravity, free falling from the Highest Point in Enkanomiya to 0 meters would take 19.89 seconds in Earth's gravity. 

**Significance:**  
Teyvat has some very high places.

## Trees Pick Up Fruits

**Finding:**  
Hitting trees causes them to drop their fruits; one for each instance of an attack. If you don't pick up the fruits they drop, you can teleport away from the trees and come back to find that the fruits are once again attached to the trees. You may also log out and log in to find the same thing happen.

Ergo, trees pick up their fruits. This applies to sunsettia, apple and lavender melon trees, as well as berries. Shooting trees from afar can potentially make it so that they pick up their fruits much later/slower than usual.

[Berries + lavender melon](https://youtu.be/NXGF8m9SPdQ)  

**Significance:**  
The trees can pick up their fruits. Also, very useful for checking some attacks against trees that need fruits/use fruits as an indicator for something. No need to look for other trees as long as you don't pick up the fruits.

**Finding:**  
Some objects within Genshin Impact can reflect Melodic Bloom Notes found within Golden Apple Archipelago.  
  
**Evidence:**

* [Parametric Crystals](https://youtu.be/gqxeNwIWoLo)   
* [Serenitea Pot](https://youtu.be/TYuMXz1Rw_4) \(hitbox is small, requires some fiddling and is quite inconsistent\)  
* [Zhongli big pillar](https://youtu.be/EHylzMpDcgs)    
  
**Significance:**  
Some things reflects, mostly fluff. Genshin is wonk game.  

## Chasm Geo Active Pillars Mechanics

**By:** Magnus Artifex\#8719  
**Added:** 2022-08-25  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/chasm-geo-active-pillars-mechanics)  

**Finding:**  
In The Chasm’s surface, there are some Geo pillars that can be interacted with. They have the following properties and mechanics:  

1. Heavy attacks on the pillars activate a shockwave with center on the pillars, i.e Plunging Attacks, claymores, Ningguang’s C1, Overload, etc…
2. Pillars only hold Cryo aura.
3. Shockwaves resonate with some objects. These include Geo Constructs and other pillars. Once it hits the object, it will send another shockwave.
4. Shockwaves damage enemies with true damage. The damage registered is 27.419, with different characters, both tests on Hilichurls and Treasure Hoarders. Might be dependent on zone levels.
5. Geo Constructs will be destroyed once hit by a shockwave.
6. Geo Constructs will be destroyed once hit by a shockwave, regardless if their HP is higher than 27.419.
7. The shockwave has a gauge unit of 1U.
8. All pillars have an ICD of 10s before they can send another shockwave, approximately. They still can register hits while in CD.
9. Shockwaves are counted as heavy attacks too. They destroy ores.
10. Shockwaves don’t have vertical height.
11. Shockwaves damage inconsistently if the enemy isn’t engaged in combat. Need further testing.
12. Pillars aren’t defined as enemies, but as an entity. They will be targeted, and abilities that gain stacks on hit will gain one if it hits a pillar, but the ones that require an enemy won’t. Example, Ningguang gains Star Jades, but Yanfei does not gain a Scarlet Seal.
13. Only pillars surrounded by golden wind will send shockwaves when hit by a player. Otherwise the pillar will still register a hit but won’t create a shockwave.
14. If a Geo Construct is placed inside the shockwave, the construct will still be destroyed and send another shockwave.
15. Damageable and undamageable summons work as intended. If a damageable one has >27.419 it will survive. Undamageable ones won’t be affected at all.
