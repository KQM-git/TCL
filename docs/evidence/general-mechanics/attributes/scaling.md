These Charts will help Travelers identify what Attributes to maximize when collecting Artifacts with less than ideal substats, or to fully embrace Artifacts with main stats for alternative builds to take advantage of nuanced Skills unlocked from your characters through Ascension passives or Constellations. It's pretty clear that you want most damage-dealers in your party to maximize CRIT DMG and CRIT Rate with an appropriate amount of ATK, but this guide reveals what other Attributes you can build towards with a character when attempting to maximize a certain stat other than ATK or CRIT (like Noelle or Albedo with DEF or Mona with ER for DPS and Barbara with HP for healing effectiveness, as examples). Characters not present in any of these Charts (meaning they have no other alternative Attribute builds other than traditional ATK + CRIT for DPS) are Lisa, Razor, Diluc, Venti, Xiao, Eula.

The finding that Lisa, Razor, Diluc, Venti, Xiao, and Eula do not have any alternative Attribute Scaling based in their kits, means that they're technically less F2P friendly (because they do not rely on additional Attributes and can use Artifacts with sub-optimal substats less easily) and are also considered slightly more one-dimensional in how they're played and built.
