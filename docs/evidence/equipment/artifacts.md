## General Mechanics

### Unequipping Artifacts And Holder Leaving Party 4-Piece Bonus Interactions

**By:** Sabrenn\#8965, Casdela\#5121  
**Added:** <Version date="2022-10-16" />  
**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2022-10-16" />  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/unequipping-artifacts-and-holder-leaving-party-4pc-bonus-interactions)  

**Finding:**  
Some active bonus timers and entities triggered or generated by a set bonus will end or disappear instantly when any piece is removed or when the holder leaves the party.  

Such notable team-wide bonuses include Archaic Petra and Instructor. We can also observe the same effect happening with personal bonuses from the Vermilion Hereafter or Gilded Dreams sets.  
In the case of Ocean-Hued Clam, the bubble simply disappears. For Exile, the Energy generation doesn’t resume.  

However, other buffs like the ones from Noblesse Oblige and Maiden Beloved remain even when any piece is removed or the character equipping the set is swapped out of the team.  
In the case of Viridescent Venerer and Deepwood Memories, the Elemental resistance decrease will remain on the enemy.  

Note: exiting combat to change a piece or swap a character in single player will also reset all debuffs and health bar of enemies thus also any Elemental resistance decrease on said enemies. It is possible to avoid this with talents that deal continuous damage, such as Collei’s Elemental Burst.  

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
New or previously undocumented ways to buff a team before overworld combat.  

Certain characters with ATK scaling could increase their damage output by pre-buffing with Noblesse Oblige.  

Pre-buffing with a set like Maiden Beloved can increase the proc damage of Ocean-Hued Clam without having that set user remain in the team which is usually a total DPS decrease.  

It’s even possible to debuff an enemy with a resistance decrease set before combat starts.  

Since some effects will end instantly if the holder leaves the party, it's important to take that into account while doing Co-Op damage showcases.  

As we get new artifact sets, more options to pre-buff in the overworld may become available and as such, having access to a list of buffs that remain will be valuable for players trying to maximise output for a damage showcase.

**Finding:**  
Geovishap Hatching shields don't activate the 4 Petra bonus

**Evidence:**  
[Video](https://youtu.be/Bc49zIE_30E)

**Significance:**  
Even though they're mechanically similar to Crystallize shields, hatchling shields don't activate Petra, yet another reason the 4set is trash

## Blizzard Strayer

### Blizzard Strayer and Cryo Resonance don't Snapshot

**By:** Vye\#9195  
**Added:** <Version date="2021-03-21" />  
**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2021-03-21" />

**Findings**:

Cryo resonance and the artefact set Blizzard Strayer never snapshot even with abilities that snapshot. They are always dynamic and will change your CRIT Rate in real time.

**Testing**:

Albedo E was used to perform the tests because it doesn't remove Cryo on the enemy and it snapshots.

For Cryo resonance, Albedo was equipped with artifacts to reach 85% CRIT Rate without Blizzard Strayer set bonuses. Below is a video recording of using Albedo E followed by applying Cryo to the enemy. Over a prolonged period I could not get a noncrit Albedo E proc against the enemy.

Following that I reduced the CRIT Rate to 80% and equipped a complete Blizzard Strayer set to Albedo. Once again I could not get noncrit Albedo E proc against the enemy when using Albedo E first followed up by applying Cryo to the enemy.

**Significance**:

You cannot snapshot Cryo Resonance or the Blizzard Strayer set bonuses for abilities that usually snapshot and last of a longer period of time.

**Findings**:  
4 piece Blizzard Strayer is not active on the hit that applies Frozen

**Evidence**:  
Freeze: [Video](https://youtu.be/Sxd89gKj26I)

Cryo: [Video](https://youtu.be/hIcBg6aBnkg)

CRIT counts: [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TjE6Po4mKUUlvWgG82wTmlNMoAQsF75zcsjTsM_yzgo/edit?usp=sharing)  
Only 3 out of 46 hits CRIT, which is statistically improbable with a theoretical 30% CRIT chance. Although by no means conclusive, it strongly hints that 4BS does not work on the hit that applies Cryo.

**Significance**:  
Blizzard Strayer literally abbreviates to BS.

### 4-Piece Blizzard Strayer on Frozen aura

**Findings**:  
Blizzard Strayer does not gain full CRIT Rate bonus against Frozen aura

**Evidence**:  
**Preface:**

* It is known that some enemies in the game can have innate “frozen” auras.
* This can be observed in both data-mined files and in-game UI.

1. Data-mined files for Frostarm Lawachurl and Cryo Hypostasis (test subjects for this ticket). Their Element type is defined as “Frozen”.  
   [Github](https://github.com/Dimbreath/GenshinData/blob/d633c8cfe5f1f383413a1f65f44d9bd018e5f9be/BinOutput/Ability/Temp/MonsterAbilities/ConfigAbility_Monster_Brute_Ice.json#L926)  
   [Github](https://github.com/Dimbreath/GenshinData/blob/d633c8cfe5f1f383413a1f65f44d9bd018e5f9be/BinOutput/Ability/Temp/MonsterAbilities/ConfigAbility_Monster_Effigy_Ice.json#L351)
2. Element symbols shown in-game. The two enemies both have same symbol as Frozen enemies instead of Cryo Element symbol.  
   [Imgur](https://imgur.com/iWVdbrC)

**Testing:**  
Frostarm Lawachurl : [YouTube](https://youtu.be/8wz8pq8T2hc)  
Cryo Hypostasis : [YouTube](https://youtu.be/6zyHjbnft4Y)

Against both target:

* 60% CRIT Rate + 4-Piece BS resulted in some non-CRIT hits, meaning ganyu didn’t get full 40% bonus from 4-Piece BS set.
* 80% CRIT Rate + 4-Piece BS resulted in all attacks being CRIT hits, suggesting 20% CRIT Rate bonus on Cryo aura being active.

**Conclusion:**  
Enemies with the “Frozen” aura do not count as “being Frozen” for Blizzard Strayer set bonus. Instead, it’s treated like Cryo aura and you get only 20% CRIT Rate.

**Significance**:  
Clarification of interaction between Frozen aura and Blizzard Strayer set bonus. Also, Blizzard Strayer still pretty much is bs.

### Blizzard Strayer Applies CRIT Rate Before Reactions

**Finding:**  
Blizzard Strayer gives CRIT Rate buff to reactions that would remove the Cryo/frozen from the enemy.

**Evidence:**

* [BS on Melt](https://youtu.be/lMVjdLf81ss)
* [BS on Shatter](https://youtu.be/vLkLicZf-vg)
* [BS on Swirl](https://youtu.be/HtzFBDGmku4)
* [BS on Superconduct](https://youtu.be/7x_Ev3nfTEE)
* [BS on Crystallize](https://youtu.be/6WUTJPxWQTQ)

* For the Melt test:

  * 61.5% CRIT Rate before BS
  * 0.615 ^ 23 = 0.00001393 aka .001% chance if BS wasn't activating
  * 23 melts 23/23 CRIT
  * CRIT = 4095
  * non CRIT = 2118

* For the Shatter test:

  * 61.5% CRIT Rate before BS
  * 25 Shatters = 25/25 CRIT
  * 0.615 ^ 25 = 0.00000527 aka .0005% chance if BS wasn't activating
  * C1 CRIT = 405
  * C1 noncrit = 203
  * No c1 CRIT = 352
  * No c1 noncrit = 177 (some of the diluc hits didnt create the Shatter reaction so it wasn't counted those, they still CRIT but assuming the target just had Cryo and 81% CRIT was hit)

* For Superconduct test:

  * 61.5% CRIT Rate before BS
  * 11 Superconduct hits = 11/11 CRIT
  * 0.615 ^ 11 = 0.004 aka .4% chance if BS wasn't activating
  * CRIT = 177
  * Non CRIT = 81

* For Swirl test:

  * 61.5% CRIT Rate before BS
  * 12 Swirl hits = 12/12 CRIT
  * 0.615 ^ 12 = 0.002 aka .2% chance if BS wasn't activating
  * CRIT = 550
  * Non CRIT = 252

* For Crystallize test:
  * 81.8% CRIT before BS
  * 21 Crystallizes = 21/21 CRIT
  * 0.818 ^ 21 = 0.014 aka 1.4% chance if BS wasn't activating
  * CRIT = 2882
  * Non CRIT = 1324

**Significance:**  
Better understanding of Blizzard Strayer for reaction comps.

## Bloodstained Chivalry

### 4-Piece Bloodstained Chivalry effect Does Not Work if a CO-OP Teammate takes the Kill

**By:** Cenpi\#3224

No, it does not even if you have dealt &gt;80% DMG to the enemy.

[YouTube](https://youtu.be/U2VhOcQTlw4)

### 4-Piece Bloodstained Chivalry effect Persists through a Character Swap

**By:** Cenpi\#3224

Yes, it does[YouTube](https://youtu.be/3y4R64qxzOs)

### 4-Piece Bloodstained Chivalry effect doesn’t proc if an Off-Field character takes the Kill

**By:** Cenpi\#3224

No, it does not.[YouTube](https://youtu.be/zgyVLeUkFwU)

### 4-Piece Bloodstained Chivalry effect doesn’t proc if Holder gets a Kill while Off-Field

**By:** Cenpi\#3224

No, it does not.[YouTube](https://youtu.be/zaDYictHFTc)

### 4-Piece Bloodstained Chivalry effect can be Maintained by Chain Killing Enemies

**By:** HailCorporate\#2970

**Finding:**

Bloodstained Chivalry 4 Piece Set Effect Can be maintained by chain killing enemies.

**Evidence:**

t=0, time of death of first Hilichurl

t=7, time of death of second Hilichurl

t=10, buff is still active

t=18, buff deactivates

[YouTube](https://youtu.be/ufe9B4JR44w)

**Additional Notes:**

* You still require the minimum amount of stamina to perform a Charged Attack, your stamina just won't be reduced on execution.
* Stamina regen will continue even while performing Charged Attacks provided the buff is active allowing you to save stamina for dashing.

**Finding:** Gaining a stack with the Crimson Witch set will refresh the duration of all previous stacks

**Finding:** Crimson Witch stacks remain after swapping characters.

**Evidence:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTyWdVPjgUU

**Significance:** Allows players to swap off crimson witch users while maintaining stacks

### 4-Piece Crimson Witch Effect Works Even When Holder is Off-Field

**By:** Cenpi\#3224 and Boesik\#3192

The 4CW set adds 40% DMG to Overload reactions. If the Pyro holder drops a persistent Skill which triggers a reaction while the Pyro user is not on the field, will this 40% bonus apply?

* For example, if Keqing applies Electro &gt; Xiangling drops Guoba a distance away from the enemy &gt; Swap back to Keqing and lure the enemy into Guoba fire, will this Overload reaction benefit from the 40% set bonus?
* Yes, the Overload reaction will benefit from the 40% bonus even though Xiangling is not on the field

**Video evidence**

* [YouTube](https://youtu.be/PLlq0yDy5Bo) - Overload DMG while CW holder inactive
* [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Lwvv_ZaV7fU) - Overload DMG while CW holder active
* Damage is the same

**Significance**

* Pyro supports can hold 4 set crimson witch and be quickly swapped in and out to drop their persistent Pyro abilities without losing the bonus damage to Overload.
* 4CW set effect applies even if the holder is not the active character. However, the holder must provide the triggering Element.

## Echoes of an Offering

### Echoes Basic Mechanics

#### Echoes Flat DMG Not Limited to single-target

Echoes Flat DMG is not limited to single-target (works in AoE).  

**Evidence:**

* Math: [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14S-_hWzHOtxKHfd2G3x179Wp9MgkGvlPOXIcnGZ5VcA/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Echoes Uses Total ATK After Buffs

**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2022-04-04" />  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/echoes-basic-mechanics)  

**Finding:**  
Echoes uses total ATK (as expected) including buffs from Bennett, 4-Piece Noblesse, and ATK from weapon passives.  

**Evidence:** 
* Bennett + Echo Hu Tao: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/z7z64VLHLkI)
* Staff of Homa + Echo Hu Tao: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/giX6K8wMDow)
* Homa (<50% HP) + Echo Hu Tao: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/9gOWwzUQt2s)
Math: [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14S-_hWzHOtxKHfd2G3x179Wp9MgkGvlPOXIcnGZ5VcA/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Echoes' Hit Registration Procs Before Animation

**Finding:**  
Hit registration occurs before evidence of it in the animation.  

**Evidence:** 
In the following video, I got hit out of Kazuha's 2-hit N3 before any visual indication that I'd hit the first attack (before the hitflash) - the hitflash occurs afterward and there's an instance of damage.  
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/wlm5yPNYQ1g)

**Significance:**  
Despite not being specifically Echoes related, I do think the question of exactly when damage is registered is important for how Echoes works for characters with fast and/or multihit attacks.  
Kazuha's N3 visually has only 10 frames between 3-1 and 3-2, and yet the two hits are independent of each other Echoes Proc-wise which runs contrary to how Echoes should work (within the 12 frame CD time). If 3-1 registers damage a few frames before the hitflash, this may fall in line with Echoes.

[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/echoes-basic-mechanics)  

**Finding:**  
Echoes will stack even when holder's Normal Attacks deal 0 damage.  

**Evidence:**  
Testing by first hitting a Mitachurl's shield for 0 damage and then the Mitachurl to deal NA damage results in a sampled Echoes Additive Base DMG Bonus average trigger chance that is abnormally high if the set did not stack on 0-damage Normal Attacks.

**Theory:**  
4-Piece effect of the artifact set Echoes of an Offering triggers around 50.2% of the time *in theory assuming the set works exactly as written*.  
  
**Evidence:**  
Based on Markov chains theory, described in the images.

Page 2: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/3lE03R6)  
  
**Significance:**  
The set doesn't actually work as described in-game.

#### Echoes Trigger Affected by Ping and FPS

**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2022-08-14" />  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/echoes-basic-mechanics)

**Finding:**  
Further data that could point to the set working as intended but be subject to ping/possibly low FPS/character multihits quick enough to take advantage of the lag between server and client (like Zhongli, or indicates that his spearkick is simply working differently compared to other multihits).  
  
**Evidence:**  
- A typical N5D of Zhongli results in a higher proc rate than a full Ayato E sequence at 200+ ms, because of the spearkick all proccing together, while Ayato has no multihits (1500 hits Zhongli has 47% proc rate vs 1573 hits Ayato has ~34% proc rate)  
- Spacing hits seems to result in higher proc rate (around the theoretical one): ~50% by doing N1J vs 47% for N5D with Zhongli  (777 hits)  
- Less data so just to observe a pattern: doing full combos with Ayato NAs results in a possibly higher proc rate than with E thanks to 2-hits on N4 --> need more data and to compare it with other characters to see if multihits with higher ping usually link and therefore results in a higher proc rate  
- More data from different testers on Zhongli that support the theory that the lower the ping, the lower the proc rate and vice versa (more ping = more spearkick hits linking, though we haven't found the higher cap where it becomes less)

**Finding:**  
Turns out, Echoes does proc the buff off-field, but still does not gain stacks off-field.  
  
**Evidence:**  
Video 1: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/GrJWJz4EPOA) - Reference of Echoes proc/nonproc damage in the proceeding evidence.  
* Noncrit without Echoes Proc - 693  
* Noncrit with Echoes Proc - 1321  
* CRIT without Echoes Proc - 1223  
* CRIT with Echoes Proc - 2331  
Video 2: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/FngwQux_BkY) - Echoes proccing the buff off-field on the first hit. (Proof that the buff procs off-field)  
Video 3: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/p7JdplFz6og) - Echoes not proccing the buff off-field after five consecutive off-field hits. (Proof that the buff does not gain stacks off-field)

**Notes:**  
Please do not use the individual proc rates at any specific ping level as an indicator for the general proc rate. i.e. there's one entry of a proc rate of 47% at very low ping, due to personal variability, this only indicates that the avg proc rate is within error range of the expected avg of 50.2%.

**Finding:**  
Ayato's second slash and first C6 strike seem to be linked. If the second slash is buffed by echos, the first c6 strike is also buffed. In turn, if the second slash is not buffed, the first strike will not be buffed as well. The second strike seems to have its own proc and trigger towards echos.

### Echoes Testing on Tartaglia

#### Echoes Triggering is Weird and Inconsistent For Tartaglia

**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2022-04-04" />  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/echoes-basic-mechanics)

**Finding:**  
Something weird is going on. We aren't confident as to what is.  
  
**Evidence:**  
In the following youtube video, at 14s in, Childe attempts a string of N4 Jump. The N3 of this string triggers Echos. The N4 of this string does not trigger Echos. For the next three strings of N4 Jump, Childe does not trigger Echos, totally in 13 hits between Echos procs.  
  
The video does not show Childe's artifacts, but this video does have Echos procs, and the spreadsheet provided has a DMG table and counts of which hits proc Echos (1 being proc, 0 being no proc). Provided on the spreadsheet is framecounts for Childe's N4.  
  
Others in CM are reporting similar things, and I have more footage I have partially gone through that have similar issues. I do have more footage I haven't gone through, and it's in a Google Drive linked on the spreadsheet. If necessary it can be posted to YouTube.  
  
We also are further looking into more strings and potential causes.

Spreadsheet: [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1deBV5unvhWWbNgLBUSUI4sriiAdYZkNXEHIBTSnaKlg/edit?usp=sharing)  
  
**Significance:**  
Not only can Childe not CRIT, he also can't proc Echos!  
All joking aside, there is something wrong witht the Echos proc chance here. This could change the way Echos is looked at, as it messes with how well the set works on Childe, and other characters may have similar issues. I know ZLM have reported weird stuff too.

#### Tartaglia's N1 or N2 Procing Echoes is Tester Dependent

[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/echoes-basic-mechanics)

**Finding:** 
How Childe's N1 and N2 hits proc Echoes differs depending on the tester. Cause unknown, but it is likely that whatever explains the difference here also explains the similar difference observed between testers for Zhongli's spearkicks (above). The only obvious possible explanation that me and valorha could come up with for Zhongli is ping.  

**Evidence:** 
I recorded a video of my Childe doing NA combos, and Myst recorded some videos of his Childe doing NA combos. In my video, Childe's N1 and N2 procced exclusively: either one could proc or neither could proc, but both could not proc in the same combo. In Myst's videos, Childe's N1 and N2 were linked: either they both procced together or not at all.

### Echoes Testing On Zhongli

#### Echoes Proc on Zhongli Spearkick Attack Differs Between Tester

**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2022-04-19" />  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/echoes-basic-mechanics)

**Finding:**  
How Zhongli's spearkick hits proc Echoes differs depending on the tester. Cause unknown, but the only obvious possible explanation that me and valorha could come up with is ping. I have about 50-60 ms on average, while valorha has 200+ ms on average.  
  
**Evidence:**  
I analyzed 106 Zhongli combos versus a Ruin Guard outside Mondstadt. In all of my combos, the first and second spearkick hits were linked: they either procced Echoes together or not at all. When the first two procced together, the third hit sometimes procced, but the fourth hit never procced. When the first two did not proc, the third and fourth hit were both able to proc and seemed to do so independently.  
  
valorha over on Zhongli mains similarly tested 136 Zhongli combos versus a Ruin Guard and the Childe weekly boss. For valorha, all of the spearkick hits were linked: all four either procced Echoes together or not at all. There was one exception at combo 91, where the first three spearkick hits procced but the last did not.

**Finding:**  
In continuation to the finding above, lower framerate *might* have an effect on the behavior of the set on Zhongli, particularly the spearkick, possibly lowering the proc rate.  
  
**Evidence:**  
I recorded 2 encounters with the same enemy, with the same set pieces and weapon, but on 1st encounter I had 60 FPS, and on second 30 FPS, totaling 36 combos for the 1st encounter and 33 for the 2nd.  
In 60 FPS, 17/18 times, the 4 hits of the spearkick procced together.  
However, in 30 FPS, at most only 3 hits of the spearkick did so.

**Finding:**  
Zhongli's spearkick combos can fail to proc Echoes after 7, 8, or even 9 hits. If this differs between testers, it is likely that whatever explains the difference between spearkick proc patterns (above) also explains this differs between testers.  
  
**Evidence:**  
I analyzed 106 Zhongli combos versus a Ruin Guard. There are 7 recorded hits which fail to proc in a row between combo 81 (beginning at 4:48 in my video) and 82.  
  
valorha analyzed over 136 combos versus a Ruin Guard and the Childe weekly boss, and got 8 recorded hits versus the Ruin Guard which fail to proc in a row between combo 58 (beginning at 2:27 of their first video) and 59. There were 9 recorded hits versus Childe which fail to proc in a row between combo 88 (beginning at 3:59 of their first video) and 89.

**Disclaimer:** Because I was dumb and didn't notice, my N3 non proc CRIT and proc non CRIT is the same value. Logically, due to my 5% CRIT Rate it should count as a proc but I've chosen to disregard all N3 data instead, just in case.  
  
**Finding:**  
More data on Zhongli's string for Echoes. (80 ish ms ping) I'm getting a consistent amount of 3 links in the spear kick.  
  
**Bonus:** I had a point in my testing where I disconnected entirely. It resulted in a 4 linked spear kick + N6 proc. Since it only happened once, I can't say it as hard evidence but it's a good chance it can contribute to the timer/ping theory. Included in the sheet at the bottom with vid, the disconnect happened around 00:10 (as you can tell by the ping meter and the sudden appearance of numbers as I reconnect). For as far as I have, this is my only occurrence of a 4 linked spear kick and technically 5 procs in a row.  
  
**Evidence:**  
37 full NA strings + 1 vid where I disconnected out of pure luck.

### Echoes Testing on Other Characters

#### Yoimiya's N1 Procing Echoes Depends on Range

**Added:** <Version date="2022-11-09" />  
**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2022-04-04" />  
  
**Finding:**  
How Yoimiya's N1 hits proc Echoes differs depending on range. Cause unknown, but the most obvious explanation is that getting closer causes the second hit to happen within the 0.05 buff procced by the first.  
However, I could not get the second N1 hit to proc without the first proccing, which should theoretically be possible if the first N1 does not proc the buff given the above explanation.  
  
**Evidence:**  
Two videos show my Yoimiya doing N1 versus a Ruin Guard, one at range and one as close as possible. When at range, each N1 hits proc independently: they can both proc, neither proc, or either one can proc. When as close as possible to the Ruin Guard, the N1 hits become linked: they either proc together or not at all.

#### Kazuha NA Interaction with Echoes

**Added:** <Version date="2022-11-09" />  
**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2022-04-04" />  
  
**Finding:**  
Kazuha's 3-hit N5 is "linked"  
Kaz's 2-hit N3 is not "linked"  
  
**Evidence:**  
I analysed 107 full N5 strings against a downed Ruin Guard over 2 sessions  
N5:
* The first 2 hits display the same proc (i.e NN or PP) in 105/107 trials
* The 3rd hit only procced in 6/107 trials, and those 6 were all NNP overall for N5. If you assume even the minimum 36% proc chance for N5-N3, the chance to get only 6 procs in 107 trials is in the region of 6x10-14

N3:
* Every combination has been observed multiple times (NN, NP, PN, PP)

**Finding:**  
Cooldown of 4-Piece gambler effect starts on any DMG output from Elemental Skill.  
For example, Sayu's roll does not trigger Sacrificial Greatsword effect - it does not reset the cooldown while using 4-Piece gambler as well, however it does proc the effect since 4-Piece gambler starts 15s cooldown timer.  
Another example could be Fischl's Oz, however it's harder to test.

**Finding:**

* Stacks can be gained off-field after 3 seconds, the timer restarts after going on-field, it does not pause and continue.
* Stacks are lost after 6 seconds of not gaining a stack, not after going on-field.
* You can lose a stack in less than 6 seconds if you gained/refreshed a stack while off-field and swapped in within the 3 seconds between the refresh and gaining a new stack.
* This also means you can lose a stack off-field by swapping off with 1-2 seconds left before stack loss.

**Evidence:**

* [Losing 2 stacks in 10s](https://youtu.be/4oHGorRk5aA)

**Finding:**  
4pc Instructor effect does apply to the second hit of a simultaneous attack, if the first hit triggered a reaction.  
  
**Evidence:**  
The Aggravated absorbed Electro from Sucrose's Burst deals 1488 damage, which is close to the expected 1451 damage from 240 EM, 291 ATK. [YouTube](https://youtu.be/jg5bPCakSaE)

**Significance:**

* Yes it does, however the total healing output is nowhere close to 'actual healers' but for those curious here's the answer.
* Healing Bonus does add on to the weapon as well the difference can be noted from no healing bonus and with healing bonus.

**Without 4-Piece Maiden's = 2139**

**With healing bonus only = 2798**

**With 4-Piece Maiden's = 2888**

**Notes:**

Prototype Malice at R2

Healing bonus of 30.8%

Ningguang was used due to her low Burst Energy cost \(40\)

* Previously known inconsistencies: Beidou, Ningguang
* Newly documented as inconsistent: AMC, Sayu, Aloy
* Does not receive 4NO: Ganyu

Non snapshot units are still tested to see if the buff applies in time for the first instance of damage from their Burst (like Eula, Keq), since there are other on-Burst effects, like MSR, that do not consistently apply in time.

**Finding:**  
Bubble Damage is considered as Physical Damage and can be boosted by Superconduct and other sources of Physical Resistance Reduction

**Evidence:**  
HP = 20175  
Healing Bonus = 40%  
T6 E = 6.2% HP + 671  
Ruin Guard = 70% Physical resistance  
Number of E Procs = 1

**Finding:**  
All healing coming from the set wielder gets calculated for the Bubble Damage including overflow heals of any degree

**Evidence:**

* [YouTube](https://youtu.be/AhZUJOWCfJs)
* [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/b55vjk4)  
  HP = 20175  
  Healing Bonus = 40%  
  T6 Q = 1.13% HP + 122  
  Ruin Guard = 70% Physical resistance  
  Number of NA Hits while Q is activated = 1

Clip #1 - Solo Kokomi  
bubble dealt 132 damage  
`((20175 * 0.0113) + 122) * 1.4 * 0.9 * 0.3 = 132.291495`

This then scaled linearly as more units got added into the party as shown in Clip #2, #3, and #4 where the bubble dealt 264, 397, and 529 respectively, which also shows that healing for the whole party is being taken into account, including healing for those that aren't on field

Clip #5 - With Hydro Resonance  
bubble dealt 642 damage  
Incoming Healing Bonus for all party members = +30%  
`4* ((20175 * 0.0113) + 122) * 1.7) * 0.9 * 0.3 = 642.55869`

[YouTube](https://youtu.be/vn94KW950kI)
Number of E Procs = 1  
Video shows that the bubble damage remained constant regardless of the HP that was restored

This means that all healing from the set wielder, whether the set wielder is on field and healed a teammate that is off field or someone else is on field while the set wielder healed that unit while off field (which is also stated in the set description), or whether the healing overflows or not doesn't matter and are all taken into calculation for the bubble damage.

### Limit for Bubble Count On Field is Shared while ICD is Not

**Evidence:**  
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/FQOF4aTiEVw) | [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/UQmjlPc)

The clip from 0:00 - 0:17 and 0:34 onwards shows that only one bubble can be on the field even when there are 2 units that have the full set. However, the set description also states that only one bubble can form every 3.5s which implies that the bubble formation ICD is also shared, which isn't the case as shown by the clip from 0:18 - 0:26. The imgur link shows a frame by frame analysis where the bubble formed from Qiqi E popping animation started until the point where the bubble formed from Kokomi E is already visible enough happened all within 6 frames, which is way below the implied 0.5s/30f downtime of the bubble formation for a single full Ocean set per team scenario. This does not say anything about coop interactions and mechanics of the set however and may be worth testing idk

**Finding:** the stacks (and their related effects) generated by hitting enemies with Elemental Skill damage by the 4-Piece Pale Flame artifact set persist after swapping characters.

**Evidence:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVE8RiCRls

**Finding:**  
4pc PF buff does NOT buff the hit that triggered it, nor any hits following the trigger within a small window. The timing for when the buff begins is ping dependent.

**Evidence:**  
[60 FPS, ~170 ping](https://youtu.be/UsAGiDnSfDo): 1st Icewhirl does 4495 damage, 2nd does 4653  
[60 FPS, ~190 ping](https://youtu.be/lXum52FjDGM): 1st Icewhirl does 4495 damage, 2nd does 4495

Rotation: (prestack 2 Grimheart), with 0 PF stacks to start (let it expire before Hold E), Hold E (no buff), 1st Ice (no buff), 2nd Ice (9% ATK), A1 (Full buff) at ping from 0 to ~185. Above 185 ping, both Icewhirls are unbuffed.

Starting Hold E at 0 PF results in different Icewhirl damage at low ping, but it also affects the standard rotation since you go into Hold E with 1 PF stack. Thus, the first Icewhirl gets 1 stack of PF and the 2nd one gets 2 stacks.

Values were tested and compared with sheet calcs at multiple ping levels, but I also got lucky enough to have 2 clips where every single hit was a CRIT, but the 2nd Icewhirl on the lower ping did more damage.

**Significance:**  
4pc PF works differently than most think, it's a slightly delayed buff.

## Retracing Bolide

**Finding:** The 2-Piece effect of the Retracing Bolide artifact set only works on the character equipping the artifact set; if the character using the set creates a shield and then swaps, the shield strength bonus will _not_ persist.

**Evidence:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GccS6vz6U7g

**Significance:** using 2-Piece bolide on shield supports for the shield strength bonus is pointless.

Zhongli ATK stays the same despite having "2" 4ToM applied via Zhongli E + Diona E.

4ToM Resetting Duration: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/ZNSvsLi)  
Buff activates at 11s ish (18s left in the vid), I open menu between 12s - 17s and buff is "reset" by Zhongli E at 18s ish and lasts until 21s ish.

**Significance:**  
Stacking 4 TotM on 2 characters on the same team has consequences.

## The Exile

### The Exile Mechanics

**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2022-10-30" />  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/the-exile-mechanics)

**Finding:**  
The Exile mechanics.  
  
**Evidence:**  
A compilation of mechanics regarding The Exile's 4-Piece effect.  
1. Energy regeneration doesn't start immediately, but after 2s, and ticks every 2s for 3 times. All Energy is regenerated earliest after 6s. This timing is similar to that of Prototype Amber's passive.  
2. While the 2nd and 3rd Energy regeneration ticks occur with intervals of 2.02s ± 0.03s, the first tick occurs 0.08s (5 frames) slower (statistically significant) at 2.09s ± 0.06s for unknown reasons. These timings aren't affected by different characters' different Burst animations times.  
3. The Energy regeneration ticks are subject to hit-lag.  
4. Characters that have longer Energy consumption frames may not receive the first Energy regeneration tick. For example, if Gorou is holding The Exile, doing "Gorou Q > Venti Q" will let Venti receive only 2 out of the 3 ticks (assuming Venti's Energy was already full at the time of casting Gorou Q). Generally, this happens for characters with ~60 and more Energy consumption frames.  
 5. Similar to the above, rotations can affect the number of received Energy regeneration ticks. For example, while "Gorou Q > Itto Q" will always let Itto receive all Energy restoration ticks, changing the rotation to "Gorou EQ > Albedo E > Itto N1 Q" will instead let Itto consistently receive 2 out of 3 the Energy restoration ticks (assuming Itto's Energy was already full at the time of casting Gorou Q).  
  
Evidence for 1, 2 & 3: [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NMJJHC3o4T2VulVCuGJ4IKgZjl7L1KG74KCrKyVbbDM/edit?usp=sharing.)  
Evidence for 4 & 5: [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tgOqAyEyyncgeDkODC1NiF4A5q0Fr9qZDdbLMTfKsUo/edit?usp=sharing.)  
  
**Significance:**  
Better understanding of The Exile. It's important for accurate ER calculations to be aware of how many Energy regeneration ticks The Exile actually gives, since this can vary.

## Shimenawa's Reminiscence

### The buff gained and Energy drain can not reoccur if effect has been activated.

**Theory:**  
Shimenawa Set Energy drain also do not happen immediately. There is about a 7-frame delay (can be more depend on latency) from the moment your character Elemental Skill is used to when you character actually lose Energy.

**Evidence:**  
Frame count (from beginning till 2:00): [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3esuFmKuwo0)

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9HhHNffa7c) - Example of Keqing at high ping (thanks to ProfHugo#6478)

**Significance:**  
If a character can cast their Elemental Skill and then Burst in about less than 7 frame, they can spend the Energy before being drained, bypassing the large cost of using Shimenawa set. Childe walking E (thanks to Amadurim#8925) is currently the only Skill found to be fast enough for this tech to work, so this remains largely impractical in gameplay, but maybe future character can benefit more from Shimenawa with this finding. Also, with high ping (400-600ms) it is possible to extend the Energy drain delay long enough so other character can Burst before the drain.

## Thundering Fury

### How 4-Piece Thundering Fury Interacts with Elemental Mastery

**By:** Saizaku\#5569

**4-Piece thundering fury gives +40% to damage caused by Overloaded, Electro-Charged, and Superconduct. We know that Elemental mastery provides a multiplier to Elemental reactions.**

**Question:** Is the 4 set thundering fury effect additive or multiplicative to the bonus from Elemental mastery?

[Data](https://i.imgur.com/youmor6.png)

[Result](https://i.imgur.com/IrnyuQ9.png)

**Conclusion:** Damage boosts regarding reactions are additive with the multiplier from Elemental Mastery.

### 4-Piece Thundering Fury Effect Only Works if the Holder Procs the Reaction

**By:** Cenpi\#3224

**The 4TF set effect adds 40% additional damage to Electro-related reactions. In addition, everytime a reaction is proccd, the E CD is reduced by 1 second \(every 0.8s\).**

**The question is whether or not the holder must be the one proccing the reaction as opposed to a support.**

* For example, if Keqing has 4TF, applies Electro, and Xiangling Guoba triggers Overload, will this Overload damage be increased by 40% or no?
* The answer is no. In order to benefit from the increased damage, Keqing must be the one triggering the reaction.
* This also applies for the cooldown reduction effect; Keqing must be the one triggering in order to get the cooldown reduction.

**Significance**

* In solo PvE play, Keqing does NOT frequently trigger Elemental reactions due to her high rate of application of Electro.
* Therefore, Keqing does not significantly benefit from the 4 set thundering fury effect.

### 4-Piece Thundering Fury’s 40% ReactionDMG Increase Works When Wearer is Off-Field

**By:** Boesik\#3192, Cenpi\#3224, Lix-\#3417

In short, yes. The 4 set TF increases reaction damage even if the holder is not on the field.

* **Note:** No significant EM differences. Level differences are: Xiangling lvl 60; Fischl lvl 70

**The following tests were conducted on a lvl 71 Ruin Guard:**

* Fischl proccing Overload while present
  * Overload does 2066 damage
    * [Evidence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y0JE20gtA1KaUaRxjIBLMOXIpgPkt0hL/view?usp=sharing)
* Fischl proccing Overload while not present
  * Overload does 2066 damage
    * See above video as well.
* Xiangling proccing Overload
  * Overload does 1077 damage
    * [Evidence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ftweCspmafDCwRJE0CcKuopivYSaxZeK/view?usp=sharing)
* Fischl \(with no 4 set\) proccing Overload both while present and not present
  * Overload does 1476 damage regardless of whether fischl is on field or not
    * [Evidence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/119FS4zyj0NYmpM9cHXguSrwGx6Zh6L-h/view?usp=sharing) \(for fischl on field\)
    * [Evidence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wr6goz63SzM4avsUuflDxP2HcGkggI5s/view?usp=sharing) \(for fischl not on field\)

**Significance**

* This finding means that you can put 4TF on a support and get the bonus damage to reactions even if they are not on the field.

### 4-Piece Thundering Fury Holder, if not on-field, cannot benefit from the CD Reduction

**By:** Boesik\#3192, Cenpi\#3224, Wrathior\#4848, Lix-\#3417

In short, no. The 4TF holder must be on the field to gain the benefit of the 1s CD reduction.  
We know \(just to reaffirm\) that if the 4TF holder is on the field and proccing the reaction, the 1s CD reduction applies with every reaction

* [Xiangling using Guoba on Electro slimes shows each Guoba tick reducing cd by 1 s.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B8s87WspSWaQshBOa6CiQrZeHowXInAf/view?usp=sharing)
* [Xingqiu using his swords to reduce cd by 1s on Electro slimes.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wH2Ot4um675xcFqfjgzTsLAW1-jJ4aGa/view?usp=sharing)

But if the 4TF holder is not on the field but proccing the reaction, the 1s CD reduction [does not go through](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17yU8Lg6W7ZZcQO2V4C6P1VOaeTQPx-cA/view?usp=sharing).

* In the video you can see that at roughly 2.33s into the video Guoba is summoned with 11.9s CD.
* 2 overloads occur \(at 4s and 6s\)
* At 8s into the video Xiangling is switched back in and Guoba has a 6.2s CD
* In total, roughly 5.33s has passed and Guoba has only gone down in 5.7s
* 2s has not been reduced and the 0.37s can be equated to just human error in measuring timings.

This result also confirmed by Lix-\#3417 using Barbara E and then switching to Keqing, no CD reduction occurred.

**Significance**

* 4TF holders who trigger reactions while not on the field will not get the 1s CDR.

### Frame Analysis of 4-Piece Thundering Fury and Electro-Charged Interactions

**By:** Doug\#8888, ayynish\#5408

**Background**

4 set Thundering Fury has 2 effects

* +40% reaction damage to Superconduct, Overload, and Electro-Charged
* Triggering such effects decreases Elemental Skill CD by 1s. Can only occur once every 0.8s.

**Theory**

* In Electrocharged, the E CDR \(cooldown reduction\) functions separately from the reaction damage bonus.
* In other words, it is possible to trigger the E CDR, without dealing reaction damage at the same instant.

**Evidence**

* Refer to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQI2LaQN4M) for analysis. Keqing is wearing 4TF and XQ is not.
* At 0:02, start counting frames.
  * Keqing is mid blink via E2 and is about to trigger an Electro-Charged
  * Hydro aura will be applied by the XQ orbital swords and the E recast damage will trigger Electro-Charged
  * Please observe the E cooldown. After E2, you will observe that frame in which it switches from E2 recast to the E cooldown, the cooldown shown is 6.8 seconds
* We will refer to the frame in which 6.8s CD becomes visible as frame 0
* Frame 0
  * 6.8 E CD becomes visible
* Frame 3
  * Electro-Charged font becomes visible
* Frame 4
  * 4TF effect is triggered
  * This is denoted by the white flash on the E circle and reduction of the cooldown to 5.8s
  * Observe the enemy and you can see a purple-white flash appear at the same time.
* Frame 15
  * 1713 \(KQ Electro-Charged DMG\) visible and HP reduction visible
* Frame 67
  * KQ autoattack and purple-white flash appears
  * E CDR occurs and CD changes from 4.7s to 3.7s
* Frame 69
  * 1713 \(KQ Electro-Charged DMG\) disappears 54 frames after becoming visible
* Frame 70
  * 777 \(XQ Electro-Charged DMG\) visible and HP reduction visible
  * 55 frames after initial damage \(frame 15\)
* Frame 123
  * 777 \(XQ Electro-Charged DMG\) disappears 53 frames after becoming visible
* Frame 129
  * 777 \(XQ Electro-Charged DMG\) visible and HP reduction visible
  * 59 frames after previous tick \(frame 70\)
* Frames 4, 15, 57, and 69 demonstrate that in Electro-Charged, the 4TF E CDR functions separately from the reaction damage
  * At frame 4, we obtained E CDR, but it wasn’t until frame 15 until the reaction damage actually went through.
  * At frame 57, we observe KQ trigger the 4TF E CDR, but there is no reaction damage
  * At frame 69, we realise that XQ triggered the next tick of Electro-Charged because his orbital swords or Q swords were the last Elemental source applied to the target.
* Thus, we can conclude that KQ can trigger 4TF’s E CDR effect without actually triggering Electro-Charged reaction damage.

**Significance**

* There are only 2 conditions for KQ to trigger E CDR in the context of Electro-Charged.
  * 4TF must not be on CD \(0.8s ICD\)
  * KQ must apply an Electro Elemental source to an enemy with existing Hydro aura.
* Therefore, 4TF is actually not hampered by Electro-Charged’s 1 second ICD. As long as you can keep constant Hydro aura on the enemy you can switch between different Elemental sources \(E1, E2, Electro-imbued autoattacks, and Q\) to obtain E CDR.

### 4TF Passive Triggered can be Triggered on Non-Damaging Elemental Applications

**By:** Sayline\#5959  
**Added:** <Version date="2021-03-21" />  
**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2021-03-21" />

**Finding**: Thundering Fury 4-Piece set effect \(cooldown reduction\) can be triggered by non-damaging Hydro application.

**Evidence**:

I have 2 examples where this can be observed. The first one uses XQ's Skill, where we see 4TF triggered repeatedly even without XQ doing any damaging moves \(Oz deals damage, but he is the aura, not trigger for Electro-Charged\). [YouTube](https://youtu.be/qSEwlawImHU)

The second example uses Barbara's Skill. Here, Oz was the trigger majority of the time, but during his ICD, Barbara was able to trigger 4TF \(at about 00:07\). [YouTube](https://youtu.be/nPvpICUd7qY)

Here is a third example, where we don't rely on Oz as our Electro crutch. Tested on Hidden Palace of Lianshan Formula I \(the weapon domain in Liyue\). [YouTube](https://youtu.be/4FEWaKG7xJQ)

**Significance**:

1. Limit testing for 4TF set effect.
2. Makes 4TF XQ carry an attractive idea to explore.

**Additionally**: No, 4TF does not reduce sac sword cooldown.

## Thundersoother

### 4-Piece Thundersoother's effect Works for Heroes Off-Field

**By:** IlidanNaga\#2163

**Evidence:**

[YouTube](https://youtu.be/4v-1j2LsxP4)

**Significance:**

It does work for characters off screen, can be useful for pure Electro DMG parties using Fischl as extra damage source

## Tiara Sets

### Tiara Status Resist 1-set Effect Applies Even if not Visually Active

**By:** tankex\#4275

In this test, we see if the 1 set effect of Tiara is active even when not visually active due to have 2 other concurrent set effects enabled \(eg 2 set Instructor + 2 set Berserker + 1 set Tiara\).

**Test:**

For the test I used Venti Lvl. 40 with and without Tiara of Flame \(40% less time affected by Pyro\), and to apply the Pyro debuff I used Xiangling's Elemental Skill with grass to create a fire surface.

Test 1 **-** No Tiara on, both set slots filled - Pyro debuff lasts for aprox 10 seconds

Test 2 **-** Tiara on, both set slots filled, tiara buff not showing - Pyro debuff lasts for aprox 4/5 seconds

Test 3 **-** Tiara on, buff showing - Pyro debuff lasts for approx 4/5 seconds

**Conclusion:**

The Tiara status resist 1-set effect applies even when not visually active.

### 80% Status Resistance is Possible through Tiara

**By:** Tankex\#4275

In this test, we see if the 1 set effect of the Tiara is active in Domains and if its stackable with Elemental resonances \(Hydro resonance for this particular test\).

**Tiara of Flame, Domain tests:**

Test 1 - No tiara, both set slots filled - Pyro debuff last long enough for the domain to reapply before it wears off. Pyro debuff infinite duration

Test 2 - Tiara on, both set slots filled, tiara buff not showing - Pyro debuff lasts 25 seconds

Test 3 - Tiara on, buff showing - Pyro debuff lasts 25 seconds

Test 4 - Tiara on, buff showing, Hydro resonance up - Pyro debuff lasts for only 8 seconds.

**Conclusion:** the Tiara works with Leyline disorders and is additive with Elemental resonances, so you are able to get up to 80% debuff resistance.

**Additional testing was performed by Tankex regarding Electro debuff**

I decided to test if the "Affected by Element for 40% less time" bonus also work with other domains apart from fire. I did some runs with and without the tiara in "Hidden Palace of Lianshian Formula" to test the Electro Debuff and I got this.

Test 1 - No tiara nor Elemental resonance - Duration of the Debuff 20 seconds.

Test 2 - Tiara on, no Elemental resonance - Duration of the Debuff 12 seconds.

## Tiny Miracle

### 4-Piece Tiny Miracle Doesn't Proc on Damage Dealt to Shields

**By:** Aevean Leeow\#1362

**Finding:** 4-Piece Tiny Miracle doesn't proc on damage dealt to shields

**Evidence:** [YouTube](https://youtu.be/q8dE3UzBHVA)  
Tiny Miracle is equipped and you don't get RES% buff until after shield is broken, shown in video

**Significance:** Very important for Tiny Miracle users. Min max your shield by getting hit before the shield is up.

**Findings:**  
Viridescent Venerer’s RES Shred passive only buffs Swirl DMG against an enemy with a pre-existing aura.

**Evidence:**  
Tested against 3 Hilichurls of the same level, with Lisa first applying Electro aura on one Hilichurl and swirling with Venti

Things to know: Hilichurl base RES = 10%  
Hilichurl RES (with VV shred) = 10% - 40% = -30% (BUT RES Shred is halved below zero, so -30/2 = -15%)  
RES% Multiplier = 1 - Enemy RES%  
Incoming Swirl DMG = Outgoing Swirl DMG \* RES% Multiplier  
Outgoing Swirl DMG = Incoming Swirl DMG / RES% Multiplier

1st clip (Raven Bow Venti, 270 EM, 4VV): https://youtu.be/Ui78cv0ZyjM

Electro Swirl DMG on Swirled Hilichurl = 2603  
Outgoing DMG = 2603 / (1 - (-0.15)) = 2263.478261  
Calculated Swirl DMG against a Hilichurl with 10% RES: 2263 \* (1 - 0.1) = 2036.7 (rounded to 2037)  
Swirl AoE DMG on surrounding Hilichurls = 2037

Calculated Swirl DMG matches ingame Swirl DMG against a Hilichurl with base RES

2nd clip (Stringless Venti, 400 EM, 4VV): https://youtu.be/5Gvo_3Wzptc

Electro Swirl DMG on Swirled Hilichurl = 3173  
Outgoing DMG = 3173 / (1 - (-0.15)) = 2759.130435  
Calculated Swirl DMG against a Hilichurl with base RES:  
 2759 \* (1 - 0.1) = 2483.217391 (rounded to 2483)  
Swirl AoE DMG on surrounding Hilichurls = 2483

Again, calculated Swirl DMG matches Swirl DMG in-game

3rd clip (Stringless Venti, 400 EM, 2NO + 2VV): https://youtu.be/QsQ90L5TUWc

Electro Swirl DMG on Swirled Hilichurl = 2134  
Swirl AoE DMG on surrounding Hilichurls = 2134

All Hilichurls had their base RES, therefore each of them received the same Swirl DMG.

**Findings:**  
Viridescent Venerer’s RES Shred passive also works on surrounding enemies after being affected by Swirl’s AoE.

**Evidence:**  
Clip 1 was tested against the 3 same hilichurls using the same rotation and setup with Lisa + Venti (with ZL for shielding + RES Shred. https://youtu.be/bZOAH38YLMs

With Zhongli’s shred in effect, Lisa’s 1-hit AA dealt 16 Electro DMG against one Hilichurl. Since all Hilichurls share the same base RES, we can assume Lisa will deal 16 DMG to the other two when paired with Zhongli’s RES Shred.

Venti triggered Swirl, and the Electro status as well as the DMG spread to the rest of the hilichurls (as for the different Swirl DMG values shown in the clip, reasons were Zhongli’s shield range + VV shred mechanic finding above). After the Swirl, Lisa performed 1-hit AA on the Hilichurls, dealing 20 DMG to each one. ZL shred is still active in this scenario, but there is still a DMG increase after the VV proc from Venti.

Clip 2 involved the same enemies minus Zhongli shred. https://youtu.be/QzwUxjJ0k4U

Lisa’s 1-hit AA dealt 14 DMG and applied Electro to one Hilichurl. After swirling with Venti and triggering VV, Lisa performed 1-hit AA and dealt 18 DMG against each Hilichurl. Although the two Hilichurls weren’t affected by the Swirl reaction, they were affected by its AoE, and the VV resistance reduction was also applied afterward.

**Significance:**  
Viridescent Venerer continues to be a powerful set for Anemo supports. On 2021-06-21, the wiki stated that VV’s resistance reduction only affects the enemy hit by the Swirl reaction, but as I finished recording counterproof it had been changed, proving my findings.

### 4-Piece Viridescent Venerer can Simultaneously Stack Different Element Resist Debuffs

**By:** Comfy Seaweed\#3841

**Theory:**

Viridescent Venerer 4set effect can trigger multiple times for different Element, allowing you to stack different Elemental resistances together.

**Testing:**

Used Barbara for Hydro debuff, Fischl for Electro debuff. Compared the DMG before and after Swirl takes place

Barbara Normal Attack before Swirl : 63

Barbara Normal Attack after Swirl : 80

Fischl charged attack before Swirl : 637

Fischl charged attack after Swirl : 814

Proc Hydro Swirl, and then Electro Swirl. Check if both Hydro resist debuff AND Electro resist debuff exist simultaneously.

**Results:**

Theory was confirmed. See video for evidence.

[YouTube](https://youtu.be/FUnEjxmgJx4)

**Conclusion:** This means that Anemo supports that can proc multiple Swirl infused with different elements rapidly can have multiple elements resist debuffs applied at the same time. Venti Burst OP

### 4-Piece Viridescent Venerer can Proc Two Debuffs in One Swirl

**By:** Faranight\#0001

**Theory:** Viridescent Venerer's 4-Piece set effect can not only trigger multiple times for different elements, allowing you to stack debuffs, but it can also trigger two debuffs in a single Anemo attack against Electro-Charged or Frozen targets.

**Evidence:**

[YouTube](https://youtu.be/-6VU-qdN8Uw)

In this video, Barbara's normals deal 34 damage when buffed by her C2 but not buffed by VV, and Beidou's Burst deals 960 damage. After Jean attacks the target with a single use of Gale Blade, Barbara's normals deal 44 damage and Beidou's Skill deals 1227 damage. Both Barbara's Hydro attacks and Beidou's Electro Burst were buffed by a single Anemo attack.

[YouTube](https://youtu.be/bQmPheaLGXE)

In this video, Jean does 98 Cryo damage \(infused by Chongyun\) on her normals with the VV buff, and Barbara does 41 damage with her normals with both VV and Xingqiu's C2 buff. When a Frozen target is swirled, Jean does 98 damage and Barbara does 41 damage to the target, meaning that the target received both a Hydro resistance down and Cryo resistance down debuff from a single Anemo attack.

**Significance:** Improves rotations; Anemo characters don't need to be swapped in for each individual Elemental debuff.

### 4-Piece Viridescent Venerer Explained

**By:** dandandin\#1486

**Theory:**

I wanted to see how Viridescent Venerer would increase final Swirl damage. The important thing about 4-Piece bonus is that Swirl damage will increase both from +60% Swirl % and also from -40% Elemental resistance. Since it's damage depends on EM I made a graph for total increase as a function of EM \(attached here\).

**Evidence:**

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v6av2DrCMM)  
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/jovxl2/viridescent_venerer_4p_swirl_bonus_and_elemental/)  

**Significance:**

The 4-Piece bonus increases a lot Swirl damage. Despite the low base damage of Swirl, this set will improve it in a way that sometimes it can be compared to 1 Electro-Charged hit \(depending on char EM\).

**Finding:** 4 piece Viridescent Venerer \(vv\) only shreds if the wearer is onfield during a Swirl that they trigger.

**Evidence:** \(Test 1\)Anemo wearers that trigger the Swirl but whether the character is onfield or offield is variable : Tests showed that vv didnt shred when the character is offield when their Q triggers a Swirl. It shredded when the character was onfield during a Swirl.

Tests showed 4-Piece vv not shredding at all.

Non-Anemo wearers that are onfield and trigger the Swirl:  
Tests showed that they can shred with 4-Piece vv as long as they trigger the Swirl with any Element which is not Geo/Anemo \(which is only possible against enemies with an innate Anemo aura like the Anemo Hypostasis\)

List of tests:

* Stat page for "Pyro as trigger Element for Swirl with 4-Piece vv, WILL IT SHRED": [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXaYPqGqzOw&list=PLz6QN9PtrDi2ljLiXeHD3uNY6tLTaM4rB&index=12)

**Conclusion:** 4-Piece vv wearers can only shred if they fulfil the 2 requirements of being the trigger of the Swirl and being onfield during the Swirl. Other elements like Pyro/Cryo can also shred with 4-Piece vv with the same 2 requirements.

**Significance:** Rotations to include 4-Piece vv users is more strict and 4-Piece vv can shred those with an innate Anemo aura with other elements as the trigger.

**Theory:**

**Evidence:**  
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U82ec4qQrxw): Chongyun extending VV duration via hitlag

**Significance:**
VV use optimization.

### VV RES Shred Applies after Talent Damage

**Theory:**  
VV RES Shred Applies after Talent Damage

Recommended reading: [Simultaneous Reaction Priority](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nz2SNxzzeujDnWQdrKEvJbECHASmwZk53On84BOymTQ/)

**Evidence:**

[4vv on Anemo Hypostasis](https://youtu.be/qilUEhPL0xQ)

First vid shows Barbara's normals without RES Shred.
Second vid shows that RES Shred happens for the second attack. (The slight increase in N1 was from a slight increase in ATK.)

![With VV shred](https://i.imgur.com/6DLqdet.png)

N1 vaped. Did not get VV shred.

CA vaped. Did get VV shred.

[Kazuha absorbed Q with 4vv](https://youtu.be/eFwXOyAPLgk)
First two absorbed hits don't get VV shred. Third does.

[Sucrose absorbed Q with 4vv](https://youtu.be/jOa4eTDXm5k)
First hit doesn't get VV shred. Second hit does.

**Significance:**

For the first two examples with Barbara and Hu Tao, we see talent damage, both non-reacting and amp-reactions are calculated before VV debuff, thus before reaction damage.

For Kazuha, this is more or less expected since we know his talent damage is simultaneous.

For Sucrose, all this tells us there is some other stuff about, since we still don't know if her talent damage is sequential or simultaneous.

### 4-Piece VV AoE Application Ping Dependency

**Finding:**  
4VV has two mechanics of applying it's debuff. One is applied on reaction to the primary target, while the other is applied in AoE via the secondary Swirl hitting enemies.

* The primary target mechanism is not affected by ping as it happens on the client.
* The secondary \(AoE\) mechanism is affected by ping as it requires attack hits to be registered by the server.
* Glossary:
  * Primary Target - Where the Swirl originated from.
  * Secondary Targets - Targets that are damaged in an AoE that weren't the single-target Swirl.

**Evidence:**  
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/uKWKTOMptPU)

* The map is when my internet was disconnected/reconnected.
* The secondary enemy is dealt the same damage twice. If the AoE debuff applied regardless of ping, the second instance should deal more damage than the first, equivalent to the damage on the primary target.

**Significance:**  
In high ping circumstances, the debuff may apply late to enemies in an AoE and be a loss of damage if there were more attacks that occurred in that period of time.

* Note: While I say attack and hit, I don't specifically mean damage. Hydro Swirls still apply VV in AoE.

**Finding:**  
For transformative reactions, +80 EM is better than the reaction damage bonus from 4TF/CW at <=490 EM (before set bonus), while +160 EM is better than the reaction damage bonus from 4TF/CW at <=1498 EM (before set bonus).

**Evidence:**

* 4TF/CW provides a flat, additive bonus to the total % increase in the formula.
* The bonus provided 80/160 EM follows a hyperbolic decay as total EM increases.
* At 0 <= EM without set bonus <= 490 EM, 80 additional EM provides >=40% increase to the damage of a transformative reaction.
* At 0 <= EM without set bonus <= 1498 EM, 160 additional EM provides >=40% increase to the damage of a transformative reaction.

Desmos sheet for visualization/calculations: [Desmos Link](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/7igtgtirot)

**Significance:**  
For characters building around triggering transformative reactions, if they do not utilize any other parts of the 4-Piece set bonus provided by 4CW (vape/melt boost, Pyro% increase) or 4TF (cool down reduction, elec% increase), then 2-Piece Instructor and/or 2-Piece WT may provide a larger boost to damage than the former two.

**Finding:**  
4VV Swirl damage set bonus is more valuable than 104 EM at 304 initial EM from artifact main stats, artifact subs, weapon secondary stats and passives, and ascension; 160EM at 842 initial EM; and 200EM at 1168 initial EM; when only Swirl damage is taken into account.  
These numbers were chosen to represent the value of 2WT2Ins, 4Ins with 4-Piece bonus active, and 4Ins with 4-Piece bonus active but set bonus discounted by 96EM to account for the loss of EM from downgrading two 5-Star main stat artifacts to 4-Star artifacts.

**Significance:**  
Below 842 EM, 2WT2Ins will provide more value for Swirl damage than 4VV before accounting for resistance

## Artifact Substats Distribution

**By:** SafconGalore\#9752

**TLDR; No, they seem to be skewed towards DEF in particular**

**Theory:**

Substats on artifacts are unevenly distributed

**Methodology**

Collected data on 157 artifacts, Flower and Feather only to be able to account for mainstat \(mainstats can't appear as substat\). Manually adjusted results for flat HP and ATK based on representation among the artifacts.

**Limitations**

n is of sufficient size. When foddering artifacts, they might not be chosen at random but may for some reason use DEF substats last. Ideally this would be further tested with a droprate table to be able to disregard the distortions from upgrading artifacts.

**Evidence:**

**See** [**picture**](https://imgur.com/a/E7m0epM)**.**

**Complete Dataset here:** [**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dLtUClmkfXLMaAylHhb_B8LzZZXvxoRP_1Md_Fzt-8A/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dLtUClmkfXLMaAylHhb_B8LzZZXvxoRP_1Md_Fzt-8A/edit?usp=sharing)

**Result**

Substats are distributed evenly except for flat DEFfor some reason, which is significantly overrepresented.

**Theory:** Substats for artifacts are unevenly distributed, with flat substats weighted higher than other substats, and CRIT substats weighted lower than other substats.

**Evidence:** TL;DR - We have the datamined substat probabilities from this link: _Link lost to the sands of time_

Image summarizing this data is here: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/k2d3S3J)

The datamined figures are not exactly consistent with what we would expect from the actual data, but it is fairly close, and we might see better agreement with more data. See this [picture ](https://imgur.com/6VVaPt1)for the guesses that most closely aligns with the data. Flat substats definitely have a higher probability of being included than non-flat substats \(by maybe ~1.7x\), and CRIT is likely to be weighted lower.

I'm mostly submitting this since the entry in the current TCL \(under the Artifact Substat Distribution header\) uses a small sample size and the conclusions reached there are likely incorrect now that we have more/better data.

**Data:** I pulled artifact data from [/u/Acheron-X's table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQdCZN4lM23LNfSU36-zEKXC7sXBzeywSGhT1JW9SlqytYXHHFNVXos1yI0UPMqSyTU7KOe36mtjK9d/pubhtml#). The tables and charts in there shouldn't be used directly because it pools artifacts with different \#s of substats together, which leads to a slightly biased picture because you can't have repeating substats and they can't be the same as the main stat, so in artifacts with 3 substats for example, the "missing" fourth slot in the data is determined by which other substats \(and main stat\) have already shown up in that artifact.

**Methodology:** [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d9nC3x5Ho2lOfmUUMdgKq5h2cZ69VZ_m58OzKlh_muo/)

I pulled out data for 4 substat and 3 substat artifacts to analyze separately since those are the least biased, then ran a simulation after plugging in some guesses for the main stat and substat probabilities, and compared those simulated figures to the actual distributions. I settled on a rough proportion after getting something that seemed close enough to the sample.

More data would be needed to reach stronger conclusions. As of right now, there's only enough data to get a sense of the right substat probabilities, but the ones assumed below are highly subject to change.

**Significance:** The artifact grind is real and artifacts with good substats are rarer than you'd naively expect since you'll see ones with flat substats much more often.

**Finding:**  
You can gain artifact stacks or trigger artifact set effects that occur on Elemental Skill cast, even while getting interrupted during the cast.  
Heart of Depth, Shimenawa's Reminiscence, and Crimson Witch of Flames were tested.

**Evidence:**

* [Kokomi with 4-Piece HoD/SR/CW](../characters/hydro/sangonomiya-kokomi.md#kokomi-skill-triggers-artifact-effects-even-when-interrupted)
* [4p CW set + Guoba](https://imgur.com/kZ8LXW5)
  * Getting interrupted while casting Guoba still increases Pyro DMG%. Casting it for without getting interrupted later causes another stack of CW.
* [4p CW + Hu Tao](https://imgur.com/T7NUI4U)
* [4p CW + Yoimiya](https://imgur.com/Fy9zUJq)
* [4p CW + Fischl](https://imgur.com/Pa4jUoP)
  * Not as useful for Fischl since repositioning Oz also counts for stacks

**Significance:**  
It is possible during combat to gain multiple Crimson Witch stacks on characters that usually can't get more than 1 stack.
This is an update to [this entry](../characters/hydro/sangonomiya-kokomi.md#kokomi-skill-triggers-artifact-effects-even-when-interrupted) to show that this is not unique to Kokomi.
