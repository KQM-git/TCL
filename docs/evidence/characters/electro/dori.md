## Burst Mechanics

**Added:** <Version date="2022-09-09">  
**Last Tested:**  <Version date="2022-09-09">

- Dori's Connector has 3s / no hit ICD - milk tea romance#9022

### Burst Gauge  
**By:** f̸̒͂ỏ̶̂o̵͌̚s̶͊̏h̷̤̀ḯ̴̊\#9920  
**Added:** <Version date="2022-09-09">  
**Last Tested:**  <Version date="2022-09-09">  
  
**Finding:**  
Dori's self electro application gauge is 1A  

**Evidence:**  
https://youtu.be/unCIWxypvno  

**Significance:**  
Dori's self application is unlike any other we've had before. Other characters' self applications have always been self auras that dont have aura tax and have a set duration, but dori's is a legit elemental attack, which means it has aura tax and uses standard decay rate. It also applies the electro aura visual effect around the character which doesnt happen with other self auras.
