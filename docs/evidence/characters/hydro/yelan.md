## Skill Mechanics

* E generates 4 Particles. - [Video](https://youtu.be/DOQQVa0IukM) - CC\#5588
* Lifeline Throws have a separate internal timer from the ones triggered with Coordinated Attacks. - [Video](https://youtu.be/jl7_OraaGZ0) - CC\#5588
* E CD begins when Yelan exits the rapid movement state. - [Video](https://youtu.be/0AeFOQwp2Os) - Beast Boy\#2560
* Rapid movement state from Hold E is affected by movement speed. - [Video 1](https://imgur.com/a/KSrM5bq) - [Video 2](https://imgur.com/a/MHP4OU9) - MGR\#5268 and Never2big\#8707
* You can regenerate Stamina during E. - [Video](https://youtu.be/RNmrfeG1Qpk) - Beast Boy\#2560
* Lifeline can be i-framed by enemies, dealing no damage but still producing Particles. [Video](https://clips.twitch.tv/WonderfulComfortableBadgerDogFace-Nv-Rv80lyl4KCVsv) - Pablos\#1142 \(video from OkCode\)
* You can collect things during E. - [Video](https://youtu.be/fwSbT_vBAfY) - Beast Boy\#2560
* Rapid movement state doesn't apply Hydro to Pyro Lecter's Furnace or produce Particles upon exiting. - [Video](https://imgur.com/JDy6W8r) - rot\#5883
* Rapid movement state can't hit animals. - [Video](https://imgur.com/6vuMalX) - Nass008\#8577

* E can be used to escape Mirror Maiden prisons. - [Video](https://imgur.com/a/BFQP766) - Shaft_HeadTilt\#2079

## Burst Mechanics

* Coordinated attacks have variable time intervals between each hit. - [Video](https://youtu.be/qZ5KTeeHfsU) - mina\#4448
* Coordinated attacks can be buffered like Xingqiu. - [Video](https://youtu.be/Am5RvDTToN4) - Beast Boy\#2560
* When a wave from Exquisite Throw is procced just as Yelan's Burst duration ends, it may be cut off and not shoot the entire wave. - [Video](https://imgur.com/oSuO58A) - SirDerpyHerp\#7903
* Exquisite Throw can proc very early into a Normal Attack animation, unlike Xingqiu's Rain Swords. It is possible to perform "N0" inputs to trigger her Burst without triggering Xingqiu's Swords. - [Video 1](https://imgur.com/L0Zdsff) - [Video 2](https://imgur.com/JNLQbRH) - Rathalos\#2875
* Q timer seems to start on frame 73 of the Burst \(white flash during the cutscene\) and ends when the dice starts to disappear. - [Image](https://imgur.com/a/Cnr0o2N) - [Video](https://imgur.com/a/TOEP028) - Aftermath\#7658
* You can double prefunnel Energy with Xingqiu and Yelan E. - [Video](https://youtu.be/1s9cJfmfRUM) - Spbm10\#8189

## Ascension Mechanics

### A1: Turn Control

* A1 is additive to other sources of HP%. - [Video](https://youtu.be/QCEzeXwXgDQ) - CC\#5588

### A4: Adapt With Ease

* A4 cannot be snapshotted and only applies on active character. - [Video](https://youtu.be/zB87-FdzBq8) - CC\#5588
* A4 does not reset on character swap and is not tied to a single character. - [Video](https://youtu.be/lXP5h-q02pc) - Schmidi\#4541

### Yelan Burst Wave Microsnapshot

**By:** Rare Possum\#0511, VanIna\#2859, RazorClaws\#4343  
**Added:** <Version date="2022-08-05" />  
**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2022-08-05" />  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/yelan-burst-wave-microsnapshot)

**Theory:**  
Based on the [Xingqiu wave snapshot ticket](../../../evidence/characters/hydro/xingqiu.md#each-burst-wave-snapshots-when-summoned), Yelan’s Burst was investigated. Unlike Xingqiu, it seems the check for buffs is done per projectile, not per wave. Each Burst projectile snapshots after being generated.

**Evidence:**  
[Video 1](https://youtu.be/XhkY52fzI8g)  
[Video 2](https://youtu.be/TkpCRAk354A)  
[Video 3](https://youtu.be/qPW0Tbi1yLI) \(switched between pyro and hydro potion in this video\)

**Significance:**  
Better understanding of how buffs interact with Yelan’s Burst, specifically noting that each of Yelan’s projectiles in a given wave can do different damage.

## Constellation Mechanics

### C1: Enter the Plotters

* CD of 1st E starts after exiting rapid movement state, CD of 2nd E is added after the CD of 1st E ends. - [Video](https://youtu.be/_iIkbNAYa5M) - Imagine being good at the game\#4881

### C4: Bait-and-Switch

* C4 can stack on a single enemy, each stack refreshes the timer, and the proc keeps your remaining HP% stable. - [Video](https://youtu.be/w9OwBJAjBPY) - Shaft_HeadTilt\#2079
* The increased HP as a result of increasing Max HP while maintaining HP% is not a heal, and will be gone when C4 expires. - [Video](https://youtu.be/L-kNr5prIiU) - Striss\#0557

### C6: Winner Takes All

* C6 benefits from CA DMG Bonus buffs. - [Image](https://i.imgur.com/p83cOwp.jpg) - Alarar\#6877
* C6 does not proc Mitternachts Waltz passive. - [Image](https://i.imgur.com/O4oXhL5.jpg) - Alarar\#6877
  * Whether or not it procs other NA effects is unknown.
* C6 attacks can proc Beidou's Burst. - [Video](https://youtu.be/upPA9i6Jth8) - Alarar\#6877
