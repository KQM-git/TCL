## Attack Mechanics

* Neuvillette can move while charging/firing CA Equitable Judgement - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prWlZPU6GfI) - chronopolize
* CA Equitable Judgement can be canceled with Dash, Jump, Skill, and Burst - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZEGMwH7Nlk) - lunaflaw
* Neuvillette can somewhat move up slopes during CA Equitable Judgement - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX8J1P0zWDU) - lunaflaw
  * He can travel over some bodies of water and down some slopes - [Video](https://youtu.be/fDuhYVHHj5k?feature=shared) - caramielle.
* CA Equitable Judgement startup can be shortened by releasing Attack at the right time - [Video](https://youtu.be/xIGmCVjrUt0) - bobrokrot
* CA absorption in front is approximately the range of his CA. The range from the back is approximately half of the range from the front - [Video](https://youtu.be/1Ip1oTH8Wmc?feature=shared) - caramielle.
* Neuvillette cannot plunge during special CA - [Video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=XKaglb8YrRc) - niku_ou
* Neuvillette can still begin chargins his special CA even with no stamina - [Video](https://youtu.be/RXoplPLaTSw?feature=shared) - caramielle.

## Skill Mechanics

* Particle Generation: 4 - [Video](https://youtu.be/dCPJqVn0hFw?si=ih83k5K2xringWJG) - clevernt
* Spiritbreath Thorn has hitlag, and can be used to Dragonstrike - [Video](https://imgur.com/a/wBABDg6) - f99shi
* Neuvillette can create a maximum of 12 Sourcewater Droplets at a time - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfh5JF8LMBk) - shampoobrain
* Sourcewater Droplets remain even after Neuvillette dies - [Video](https://youtu.be/0AWTPjdN0d8?feature=shared) - caramielle.
* You only see your own Sourcewater Droplets in Co-Op. This means that your Neuvillette cannot interact with any Sourcewater Droplets formed by your co-op partner
  * Anemo characters with CC abilities can interact with Sourcewater Droplets dropped by other party's Neuvillette in co-op, even though the Droplets are not visible

## Burst Mechanics

* Droplets generated by Burst will always spawn a distance away in front of him, at the same elevation as he is. as a result they can go out of bounds and hover mid air - [Video 1](https://youtu.be/v8I9i1FTbZc?feature=shared), [Video 2](https://youtu.be/2MRZ7qpKpg4?feature=shared) - caramielle.


## Ascension Mechanics

### Ascension 1: Heir to the Ancient Sea's Authority

* Neuvillette himself is qualified for gaining stacks - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHFEFdFnH-U) - starlighthorizon
* The duration of stacks of the same type reaction can be refreshed by triggering the same reaction - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOxJjnOsSLA) - starlighthorizon
* Stacks can only be gain on reactions triggered on enemies. Reactions on gadgets, weapons, monster weapons, and self don't count - [Video](https://imgur.com/a/7JJK820) - f99shi
* Teammates proccing reactions from off field still triggers A1 - [Video](https://imgur.com/a/yhCxaI1) - f99shi

## Constellation Mechanics

### C4: Crown of Commiseration

* C4 works on overheal - [Video](https://imgur.com/a/yT63lP4) - f99shi

### C6: Wrathful Recompense

* C6 sometimes leaves a ghost Droplet that cannot be interacted with - [Video](https://imgur.com/a/l0GgCkW) - f99shi

## Synergies/Interactions

* Interaction between Neuvillette's Sourcewater Droplets and Anemo characters that can CC
  * Kazuha: Can pull with E
  * Jean: Can pull, but not yeet, with hE
  * Faruzan: Can pull with Pressurized Collapse (E CA)
  * Sucrose: Can pull with E. Only initial Q hit pulls
  * Heizou: Can pull with Q
  * Lynette: C1 vortex can pull
  * AMC: hE and Q both pull
  * Venti: No
  * (Bonus) Viridescent Hunt: No

* CA Equitable Judgement and Frozen interactions:
  * CA doesn't get cancelled immediately by getting frozen. Unless it is a whopper flower who does it.
  * The charge bar can still be consumed and charged while being frozen, but only for a short time.
  * In the right timing, neuv can still shoot his beam while being frozen.
  * While frozen, you can still control where he is looking
