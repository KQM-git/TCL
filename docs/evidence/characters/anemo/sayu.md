* Sayu's Elemental Skill can be used at 0 stamina, and does not consume nor gain any stamina during the roll. - [EdisonsMathsClub#6469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EboCmsXMfIo&feature=youtu.be)
* Absorption Priority is: Pyro > Hydro > Electro > Cryo - [채z#0007](https://youtu.be/E8hTyByWYF0)
* If Sayu gets frozen while rolling, she will still deal Windwheel damage - [Mcpie#8672](https://youtu.be/HawcofVHV6I)
* Sayu is capable of ice bridging if her roll is infused with cryo. - [Dunkingson#9351](https://imgur.com/a/gUFyt8Y)

### Sayu Release Of Hold Skill Counts As Using Elemental Skill

[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/sayu-release-of-hold-skill-counts-as-using-elemental-skill)

**Finding:**  
Ending a continuous Hold Skill (Sayu or Yelan hE as examples) by tapping E is considered "Using an Elemental Skill" for the sake of 4pc Crimson Witch Pyro damage bonus. Letting the Skill end naturally does not.  

**Evidence:**  
* [Sayu Hold Skill (release)](https://youtu.be/pmm2wgmug5M)
* [Yelan Hold Skill (release)](https://youtu.be/ZJPxex4qw9U)
* [Sayu Hold Skill (full duration)](https://youtu.be/LJhHfJHWt4k)  

**Significance:**  
Continuous Hold Skills have higher potential synergy with effects which stack based on "using an Elemental Skill" as they can stack it twice.  

### Burst Mechanics

* Sayu can absorb pre-fed particles during her elemental burst animation - [Nass008#8577](https://youtu.be/bdHedirf9VA)
  * Works for both Tap and Hold E
* The summoned Daruma can be pushed around by characters or enemies, also moving its healing/attack range. - [pox#1832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwFdbiW44Us) and [Mcpie#8672](https://youtu.be/V2C8a2WLugk)
* Sayu's Elemental Burst snapshots. - [Nass008#8577](https://youtu.be/rK3JGXBc-eo)
* Sayu's Elemental burst can reach Venti's ult & hit consistently. - [채z#0007](https://imgur.com/a/QPWqZbh)
* The Daruma works the same way as Guoba - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/UweRgyV.mp4)
  * Doesn't light up in elemental sight, is movable, cannot get infused, etc.
* Sayu's Burst has separate ICD on her burst's initial hit and Daruma damage ticks - [DeFault#1802](https://youtu.be/KLy1f8aKkBg)
  * The summoned Daruma deals 7 ticks of Anemo Damage in a small AoE - [Zakharov#5645](https://imgur.com/a/wyIaelB)
  * The Daruma Damage ticks follow standard ICD
  * This means Sayu can swirl 5 times during her burst (1 from cast + 4 from Daruma)\

### Sayu Partywide Initial Q Tick

[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/sayu-partywide-initial-q-tick)

**Finding:**  
Sayu's initial Q tick heals all party members.  
  
**Evidence:**  
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/Rr2PrRWWbs0)
  
Note Q doesn't have anything to Swirl in the video, meaning this isn't A1 activating \(which is known to be party-wide\).  
Also note the other Q ticks aren't party-wide, only the initial one is.  
  
**Significance:**  
Better understanding of Sayu's healing.  

### Passive Mechanics

#### Passive: Yoohoo Art: Silencer's Secret

* Passive works even if Sayu is off-field - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/xUpatkg.mp4)
* If entities are connected (like crystalflies), then picking them up will always scare the others - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/wjFjETt.mp4)
* If entities do not care about the state of other beings, then picking it up next to another one won't startle them - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/xUpatkg.mp4)
* Sayu's passive does not affect coop members - works only for your own party - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/i41t4tD.mp4)

### Constellation Mechanics

#### Sayu C2 infused kick

**Finding:**  
The stated DMG increase of Fuufuu Whirlwind Kick from Sayu's C2 increases both Anemo Kick Hold DMG and Absorbed Element Kick DMG, by 3.3% every .5s tick

**Evidence:**  
Using a Sayu with 80/80 r1 Sac GS, no artifacts (713 atk, 72 em), talent level 1 skill

In the first video, Sayu rolls at 24s, kicks at 26s, and the resulting ~2s roll deals 752 anemo and 263 pyro.  
In the second video, Sayu rolls at 8s, kicks at 18s, and the resulting ~max length roll deals 1137 anemo and 398 pyro.

Rough napkin maths:  
base anemo hold kick dmg: 716  
base absorbed element kick dmg: 251

2 roll ticks anemo hold kick dmg: 716 _ (1 + 2 _ 0.033) = 763  
2 roll ticks abs elem kick dmg: 251 _ (1 + 2 _ 0.033) = 267

20 roll ticks anemo hold kick dmg: 716 _ (1 + 20 _ 0.033) = 1188  
20 roll ticks abs elem kick dmg: 251 _ (1 + 20 _ 0.033) = 416
