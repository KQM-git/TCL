* Particles: 
    * Lynette Skill generates 4 particles per use with no ICD - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/uzIlTAIOz9k) , [YouTube](https://youtu.be/zXFVxAxIoI8) - @soul_fish
* ICD: 
    * Skill has no ICD; Burst anemo has standard ICD shared with initial hit, Absorption applies every other hit (at C0) - @jyro10
        * [YouTube](https://youtu.be/aJXZIcVcwVc) - E with Sac  
        * [YouTube](https://youtu.be/rTEOpNMk988) - Burst with Pyro Absorption (better footage)  
        * [YouTube](https://youtu.be/qWIy6kq-9JE) - Burst initial hit  
    * Lynette's Q coordinated attacks seem to be standard ICD (by C2 hits). - @lunaflaw 
        * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH12VqZV5w0) - She vaporizes on 1st hit of 1st wave, then on 2nd hit of 2nd wave > 1st hit of 3rd wave >... 
* Lynette's burst doesn't snapshot - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/GWEEQYfPeFU) - @mgr_

## Attack Mechanics

## Skill Mechanics
* Stamina regenerates while in Lynette's Pilfering Shadow State from her hold Skill. - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv14_De7g00) - @shampoobrain

## Burst Mechanics
* Lynette Absorption Mechanics - @bobrokrot, @f99shi
    
    * [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/e9HNVLL) Cryo Pyro Hydro, absorbs Cryo  
    * [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/10wf8Ct) Pyro Hydro Electro, absorbs Pyro  
    * [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/32RA2gS) Hydro Electro, absorbs Hydro

    * The reason this had to be tested in coop is, based on this clip - [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/d0UWgOL), the swirl damage hits the box before the box does its first auracheck, so any test on enemies will depend on whichever swirl the game does first and is not indicative of the real auracheck priority. 

    * The absorption priority is Cryo > Pyro > Hydro > Electro  

    * It is important to know that although she has the same priority as Anemo Traveler, her burst cannot be used for uses that Anemo Traveler is popular for, such as shredding Hydro AbysS Herald shields, due to the first opening swirl on the box occuring before the auracheck. against an enemy with both Frozen and Hydro auras, due to [Simulataneous Reaction Priority](../../../combat-mechanics/elemental-effects/simultaneous-reaction-priority.md), Hydro Swirl will occur first, which will hit the box and make it absorb Hydro before it has time to do its auracheck.

## Ascension Mechanics

## Constellation Mechanics

## C1: A Cold Blade Like a Shadow
* Lynette's C1 has pull radius of about 6m - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/GWEEQYfPeFU) - @mgr_

## Synergies/Interactions

* Neither Lynette's Skill or Burst can Guoba swirl. - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/65zCOhoL25E) , [YouTube](https://youtu.be/tsUYep0lvoM) - @mgr_
