### Itto Buffering Mechanics

[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/itto-buffering-mechanics)

**Finding:**

* Itto’s CA has a uniform buffering time - it takes 14 frames from holding LMB to the stack flash, including hitlag frames.
* Itto’s N2 allows a CA to come out a minimum of 4 frames after hitlag ends. N3 has a minimum of 6 frames after hitlag.

The exception to this is Itto’s N1, which allows you to hold LMB during its hitlag and will then start an N2 and immediately buffer a CA, which skips the minimum 4 frame delay after hitlag, making this the most efficient way to do a CA out of N2.

**Evidence:**

* Standing CA: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/MXn0lpZBvH0)
* CA out of N2/N3: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/PpVaIyjd3Ak)
* N1 exception demonstration: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/wdi78tpEnDI)

**Significance:**  
Greater and more quantitative understanding of Itto’s CA buffers, as well as potentially opening up an easier way to do certain combos with the N1 exception.  
The most consistent way to buffer Itto’s combos is to click once during or a bit after hitlag for each NA, then hold click as soon as the final NA animation begins. Starting to hold click at least 14 frames before the earliest possible CA (which is 4f/6f after hitlag for n2/3) will result in a frame perfect CA.

## Skill Mechanics

* **Particles**: Itto Particle Generation is 3-4 with around a production ratio of 1:1. 100 attempts; 3 Particles = 53; 4 Particles = 47 - [CC\#5588](https://youtu.be/eaSw1TExI60)
  * Itto can pre-funnel particles from his Skill - [CC\#5588](https://youtu.be/6NqzXT4QQgQ)
* Ushi counts towards the Geo Construct Limit. - [CC\#5588](https://youtu.be/PmAEA9N5EiU)
* Ushi's duration starts at land and not on cast. - [MeCrush14\#2271](https://imgur.com/a/HcsL4z3)
* Ushi is unsuckable (via Sucrose and Kazuha). - [borderline\#3100](https://youtu.be/JVJnJ6QgR-g)
* Ushi can be pushed by either Itto or enemies. - [JonahFarc\#7056](https://i.imgur.com/4kIiqut.mp4)
* Hold E has 10sec timer. - [deRykcihC\#0551](https://youtu.be/TLT8XCE8ONg)
* Ushi still persists and gains stacks after teleporting. - [nxriaki\#6316](https://youtu.be/OLB4LVXzD-Q)
* Ushi is able to use wall hacks and phase through this wall in Mondstadt. Ushi will still despawn and give stack, so it doesnt get destroyed due to wall. - [Ultimate Noob\#2955](https://youtu.be/XluSNFbqGrg)

## Burst Mechanics

* Itto Burst Snapshot Interaction with Different Stats - [CC\#5588](https://youtu.be/a54hQP4aYgU)
  * The video through various tests show that DEF is being snapshotted (Husk Set, Whiteblind, Gorou), while Geo DMG (Husk Set, Gorou, Ningguang) and ATK (Sara) aren't. It is unknown/unconfirmed at the moment this was submitted if Crit Buffs such as Gorou C6, Rosaria A4, and Traveler C1 are being snapshotted or not.
* Itto does not snapshot Gorou's buffs if you alt swap. - [tenten\#1010](https://youtu.be/qvgXZFJx63g)
* Itto's Q can be hitlag extended. - ProfHugo\#6478
  * [No Hitlag - Q lasts 804 Frames](https://youtu.be/lwSMxN_bK98)
  * [Hitlag - Q lasts 846 Frames](https://youtu.be/aw06dCXAnjg)
* Itto's Q can expire during CA spam. - [ProfHugo\#6478](https://youtu.be/UPoTXD71MUs)
* Burst duration can significantly extend past its normal duration by doing an attack at the end of burst. This extension ends immediately on any action after the final attack, so it does not give you a meaningful burst extension beyond that final attack. - BowTae\#0141
  * [No attacks - burst ends at 6.0s CD](https://imgur.com/Pv6AMr4) \([Stats](https://imgur.com/OayN5yF)\)

### Itto N1 Burst Cancel SS Stack

**Finding:**  
Using Itto burst during N1 hitlag gives Superlative Strength Stack.

**Evidence:**  
Video and timing: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/9duP3w3)  
Itto gains Superlative Strength stacks on the frame that the damage numbers appear. So, if you use an N1 outside of burst and cancel the hitlag with Q before the damage number appears, the game will give you an SS stack from a burst N1.

As this is ping-related, players with very low ping will only have a few frames in which to cancel into the burst.

**Significance:**  
There are several combo variants for Itto, a main category being first rotation 0 stack combos. With this tech, you can gain a stack early and go into the higher damage 1 stack combos without sacrificing dps from the extra non-Ult N1. It also serves as QoL to reduce the number of combo variants to remember.

### Successful Itto DEF Conversion with Gorou

**Finding:**  
If characters are directly switched to after Gorou casts his Elemental Burst, they can snapshot the flat DEF buff extremely consistently, if the ping isn’t high (<75ms).

**Evidence:**  
Many different methods were tested to see when Itto could snapshot Gorou's flat DEF buff:

1. Itto uses Alt + Num to use his Elemental Burst directly after Gorou uses his Elemental Burst. The ping was in the 25-75ms interval. The result was that Itto successfully snapshotted the flat DEF buff 47 times out of a total of 50 runs. Example showing a successful run: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/f7rYZ4MzrC8). When the ping was changed to 200-350ms, out of 10 additional runs, only 2 were successful at snapshotting the DEF buff.
2. Itto is manually switched to and directly uses his Elemental Burst directly after Gorou uses his Elemental Burst. The ping was in the 25-75ms interval. The result was that Itto successfully snapshotted the flat DEF buff 37 times out of a total of 40 runs. When the ping was changed to 200-350ms, out of 10 additional runs, only 3 were successful at snapshotting the DEF buff.
3. Itto is manually switched to and directly uses his Elemental Burst or uses Alt + Num **not** directly after Gorou uses his Elemental Burst. The ping was in the 25-75ms interval. The result was that Itto successfully snapshotted the flat DEF buff only 16 times out of a total of 30 runs, with manual switching being somewhat less inconsistent.

**Significance:**  
The findings firstly disprove that Gorou’s paw symbol must fully appear before the buffs can be applied. Secondly, using Alt + Num to swap shortens Itto’s team rotation times, which he’d enjoy due to his rotation times already being longer than his Elemental Burst cooldown. Lastly, the findings give some insight into Gorou’s Elemental Burst mechanics, such as it being ping-dependent.

* Itto has extremely high interruption resistance while using his special charged attacks. While doing his special charged attacks, Itto is able to take at least 9 hits from the Ruin Guard's spinning attack without getting staggered. - [mimiya\#9197](https://youtu.be/W1wdZ0LyzsI)

## Constellation Mechanics

### C1: Stay a While and Listen Up

#### C1 Stack Timing

[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/itto-c1-mechanics)

**Finding:**  
Itto starts gaining SSS stacks 50 frames later than according to the C1 description.

**Evidence:**  
According to Itto's 1st Constellation description, "After using \[Q\] ... \[a\]fter 1s, Itto will gain 1 stack of Superlative Superstrength every 0.5s for 1.5s." If we assume that the game is in 60 fps, this means that we expect the first SSS stack to be gained 90 frames after Itto uses Q, and the second and third SSS stacks to be gained 30 and 60 frames after this, respectively. However, in-game testing shows that this isn't what really happens.

Two trials were done in 60 fps and at different pings to check for ping-dependency:

1. [Ping = 33ms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy_iIxdCXyA&ab_channel=GoldenMantis)

* Start of Q animation: Frame # 133
* Start of gaining the 1st SSS stack: Frame \# 271
* Start of gaining the 2nd SSS stack: Frame \# 303
* Start of gaining the 3rd SSS stack: Frame \# 332
* The first SSS stack was gained 138 = 90 + 48 frames after Q, and the second and third SSS stacks were gained 32 and 61 frames after this, respectively.

2. [Ping = 173ms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcgnU2_hb6o&ab_channel=GoldenMantis)

* Start of Q animation: Frame \# 121
* Start of gaining the 1st SSS stack: Frame \# 258
* Start of gaining the 2nd SSS stack: Frame \# 291
* Start of gaining the 3rd SSS stack: Frame \# 319
* The first SSS stack was gained 137 = 90 + 47 frames after Q, and the second and third SSS stacks were gained 33 and 61 frames after this, respectively.

We can firstly conclude that C1 is ping-independent. Secondly, it seems that Itto's C1 follows its description for the most part, except that the first SSS gain actually happens 50 frames later than what's stated.

**Significance:**  
Better understanding of Itto's C1.

### C2: Gather 'Round, It's a Brawl!

* Itto C2 counts himself as a geo user. - [ElliMiku#5071](https://youtu.be/wCvSY1Y11T4)

### C6: Arataki Itto, Present!

* At C6, Itto can do a kesagiri (not finisher) at 1 stack as it checks before the stack is consumed. C6 Itto cannot do an E>SCA Finisher combo like at all other cons and is heavily locked to spamming charged attacks the whole time. - [JonahFarc\#7056](https://imgur.com/6E0ol5h)

## Synergies/Interactions

* Itto can almost consistently hit enemies lifted by Venti's Burst. - [CC\#5588](https://youtu.be/bHr2fCh4XHY)
  * Most of Itto's attacks (both normals, combos, and even his final slash) can hit enemies lifted by Venti's Burst due to them being more of vertical/diagonal strikes (and just having high enough of a vertical range in the case of the final slash aka the dunk) with the exception of N1.
* Itto with Sacrificial Greatsword's passive can get 3 stacks. - [MeCrush14\#2271](https://imgur.com/a/TTNT12p)
* Ushi is able to interrupt Rifthounds during their backwards attack. - [Meatball#0438](https://youtu.be/zPA6uNLBhZA)
