## Attack Mechanics

### Twins CA MVs Comparison

**By:** Fluffy\#5580  
**Added:** 2021-04-10

**Theory:** Lumine is better than Aether because her CA 2nd hit multiplier is higher.

**Evidence:** Attached will be 2 images of T6 AA talent pages. The first will be Aether and the second will be Lumine. Using these values, and counting frames, I found that Aether has higher MV/s on N1, N2, N3, and N1C than Lumine but less on every other AA combo. My findings are in this sheet: [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14WkH2fd3fvGpHjGO7_A8xCJTy92WZsq0SL-tfEqXoXw/edit?usp=sharing)

**Significance:** Although, I wouldn't recommend using AA for either MC, Aether comes out on top with shorter AA combos which would be more preferred combos anyway. This means that while Lumine has on multiplier higher than Aether's, her AA is still worse than that of Aether. It really shouldn't matter unless you play main DPS though, so play who you want.

**Finding:**  
Geo MC Starfell Swords can be manually detonated by over-capping on the maximum amount of Geo construct.

**Evidence:**  
Evidence 1: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/mACZf89)  
Evidence 2: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/uimbAgh)  

**Significance**  
Geo supremacy.

## Burst Mechanics

### Wake of Earth Blocks Geovishap Jump

**By:** Terrapin\#8603  
**Added:** 2021-05-06  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/ticket-archive/attachments_839244723133612072_840066389728821268_transcript-wake-of-earth-blocks-geovishap-jump.html)

**Finding:**  
The Geo Traveler's Elemental Burst walls block a Geovishap from being able to jump over it.

**Evidence:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipBK9T1Thz8)  
As shown in the video, a Wake of Earth wall inbetween the Geovishap and the player completely prevent them from being able to jump over it, stopping their jump at the wall's edge.

**Significance:**  
Enemy movement manipulation when using Geo Traveler in a team comp.

## Ascension Mechanics

### A4: Frenzied Rockslide

#### Geo Traveler A4 counts as Normal Attack

**By:** Blank#4561  
**Added:** 2021-09-10  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/ticket-archive/attachments_864157638828490762_864440105296592906_transcript-traveler-ascension-skills.html)

**Finding:**  
Anemo Traveler A4 counts as Normal Attack Damage.

**Evidence:**  

* [YouTube](https://youtu.be/JH6KsDqdsN8)
* ` .6 * 752 * (1 + .35) * .9 * ((100 + 80)/(100 + 85 + 100 + 80)) = 270.35`

**Significance:**  
Although a minor damage source, Geo Traveler's A4 Passive damage is increased by DMG bonuses towards Normal Attacks.

#### MC Elemental Proc Difference

**By:** Rathalos\#2875  
**Added:** 2022-03-22  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/ticket-archive/attachments_945097851195777054_955996204477612072_transcript-mc-elemental-proc-diff.html)  

**Theory:**  
The elemental proc (Frenzied Rockslide) from the last string of the Traveler's basic attack behaves differently between Aether and Lumine. Specifically, Lumine's elemental proc happens some time after the last frame of her N5 attack string, while Aether's elemental proc happens before his n5 attack string occurs.  

The possible explanations for this is that the elemental proc occurs during a specific frame that is shared between both twins, and it just so happens to occur after Lumine's n5 but before Aether's N5.  

Lumine's entire n5 sequence takes ~148 frames while Aether's N5 sequence takes ~163, so it is definitely a possibility. However, my device doesn't allow me to framecount very well so I'll leave it as a possible explanation.  

**Evidence:**  
* [Aether 1](https://imgur.com/NdQKFLA)
* [Aether 2](https://imgur.com/2MuxlIX)
* [Lumine](https://imgur.com/IKRNdps)

**Significance:**  
This means that it is possible for Aether to hit the elemental proc without/before connecting his fifth attack, while it is possible for Lumine to miss her elemental proc if she cancels her N5 too fast.  

Another possible significance is that this might be a clue to how the Travelers are coded. They might share the same timings for other similar things that manifest at different moments just because of animation difference. As of writing this, no other application comes to mind.  

## Constellation Mechanics

### C1: Invincible Stonewall

#### Geo MC C1 activation after Cast

**By:** Vherax\#5321  
**Added:** 2021-06-20  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/ticket-archive/attachments_845028522325573702_856407372993527828_transcript-geo-mc-c1-does-not-apply-to-burst.html)

**Finding:**
Geo MC C1 10% Crit rate buff becomes active after stone wall is created and does not affect the burst itself upon activation

**Evidence:**
[https://youtu.be/DBMJEKuABes](https://youtu.be/DBMJEKuABes)  
Video shows geo MC with c6 and >90% crit rate not critting on 3rd hit of his Q.
If the crit bonus applied to burst damage, it would be impossible to not crit.

**Significance**
- Geo MC's burst does not apply C1 buff to its own damage (unless a ring from previous burst still exists)
- With C6 the duration of ring is 20s (with 15s cooldown), so it should be possible to maintain the buff on subsequent burst activations. However, as proven, the first elemental burst used will remain unaffected by C1 crit rate buff.

#### GMC Wake Of Earth Interactions

**By:** Rathalos\#2875  
**Added:** 2022-03-22  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/ticket-archive/attachments_945097851195777054_955987323579957338_transcript-gmc-wake-of-earth-interactions.html)  

**Theory:**  
The visuals \(as in the geo spikes, will henceforth be called stone walls as per game nomenclature\) do not actually match the hitbox of the stone walls. The hitbox can exist without the visuals, and it behaves in a way that does not match the visuals.  

Visual Illustration of the Stonewall Buff's AoE:  
![](https://i.imgur.com/tAS7OAQ.png)

Legend:  
* Small red circle = Cast point, acts as the origin of the Stonewall Buff.
* Blue cylinder = Buff AoE, cylindrical in shape that conceptually begins as a circular plane in relation to the origin. It extends upwards and downwards from the the initial circular plane. Its length on either direction does not exceed the length of Zhongli's Pillar.
* Yellow irregular shapes = Represents the stone walls produced by Wake of Earth (Q). Acts as the visual indicator for the buff's area.
* Brown pillar = Represents Zhongli's Stone Stele. No particular purpose apart from scale.

---

**Finding 1:**  
Wake of Earth has some weird properties. Wake of Earth can go invisible if you teleport away. The actual hitbox of the stone walls and the crit rate buff from Invincible Stonewall \(C1\) still persist.  

**Evidence:**  
\[Crit rate without buff is 34.6% | with buff is 44.6%\]  
[Video 1](https://imgur.com/eEDB3uq)  
[Video 2](https://imgur.com/MsDWZ3s)  

**Significance:**  
There's probably more things we don't understand about geo construct behavior, and this might help us understand why the stone walls from Wake of Earth do not count for the geo construct limit.  

---

**Finding 2:**  
The hitbox for the stone walls from Wake of Earth \(Q\) actually gets affected by enemy attacks, easily displacing the orientation of the wall and not matching the actual visuals. This means that the hitbox can move while the visuals of the stone wall stay in place.  

**Unconfirmed theory:**  
The displacement is affected by enemy moves that can apply sufficient enough knockback.  

**Evidence:**  
[Video 1](https://imgur.com/k0tuLI4)  
[Video 2](https://imgur.com/lmpbsPK)  

**Significance:**  
Helps us better understand how the stone walls work. Playing around GMC Q means trying to prevent enemies from hitting the walls by staying quite a bit of distance from the stone walls so the mobs stay grouped inside the burst.  

---

**Finding 3:**  
GMC's first constellation, Invincible Stonewall, provides a crit rate and resistance to interruption buff within the radius of Wake of Earth \(Q\). It is assumed that the resistance to interruption buff comes with the crit rate buff. Henceforth, the combined buff will be referred to as Stonewall buff, but will be tested by observing the crit rate of the characters.  

Here are the associated findings:  
Stonewall buff doesn't immediately apply to characters on switch. It refreshes every tick (estimated to about 1 second). The buff also lingers for about two seconds.

**Evidence:**  
Unbuffed crit rate of the following:  
GMC: 34.6%  
Zhongli: 14.3%  
Kazuha: 68.2%  
Sayu: 12%  
[Doesn't immediately apply on switch](https://imgur.com/RdBpbqp)  
[Lingers](https://imgur.com/9QydWF0)  

**Significance:**  
Abilities that snapshot shouldn't be immediately cast on switch. The lingering buff can somewhat help if a character exits the buff area.  

---

**Finding 4:**  
Stonewall buff is active even if the stone walls get broken or despawn via other means.  

**Evidence:**  
[Unstable location](https://imgur.com/9ujne9U)  
[Walls being broken](https://imgur.com/5RCgist)  

**Significance:**  
The buff area is independent from the stability of the stone walls. Just stay inside where the circle would have been anyway.  

---

**Finding 5a:**  
Stonewall buff has a vertical limit around the cast area of Wake of Earth \(Q\). Going downwards away from the cast point means losing the crit buff. The depth of the buff seems to be a little less than the length of Zhongli's Stone Stele.  

**Evidence:**  
\[Crit rate without crit buff is 85.1% | with crit buff is 95.1%\]  
[Video 1](https://imgur.com/wl4rFEr)  
[Video 2](https://imgur.com/J9KqEbN)  

**Finding 5b:**  
Stonewall buff has an upward vertical limit around the cast area of Wake of Earth \(Q\). The height of the buff seems to be a little less than the length of Zhongli's Stone Stele.  

It is possible for Xiao to not get the crit buff if he:  
* Jumps way too high \(such as through collision\).
* Dash-jumps then lingers on the air slightly .
* Takes off from geo constructs such as Albedo's Solar Isotoma or Zhongli's Stone Stele, and potentially GMC's Meteorite if they linger on the air too long.

However, the crit buff reapplies itself when you get close to the ground.  

**Evidence:**  
\[Crit rate without crit buff is 85.1% | with crit buff is 95.1%\]  
[Jumping from Solar Isotoma](https://imgur.com/m6wJm0n)  

\[Crit rate without crit buff is 77.1% | with crit buff is 87.1%\]  
[With some mob collision](https://imgur.com/cnaZJrs)  
[Height](https://imgur.com/vkZZZLe)  

Note: For the following tests, Xiao has 90% crit rate to observe the 10% crit rate bonus from the Stonewall buff. The tests are looking for scenarios where the crit bonus does not apply \(as in the hits don't crit\).

[Stats](https://imgur.com/a/uj5Pqqr)  
[Regular Xiao gameplay](https://imgur.com/uYBZ7jC) demonstrating 100% crit rate which reflects most of my tests playing normally  

Scenarios where the crit rate can expire:  
* [Taking off from Zhongli's Stone Stele](https://imgur.com/HcWxYeJ)  
* [Taking off from Albedo's Solar Isotoma](https://imgur.com/O1CRVtx)  
* [Dash-jump-plunge-linger for a bit](https://imgur.com/CVZZbIl)  

**Significance:**  
More understanding of how the buff works. Can't make use of the buff if the character is too far away from the cast area. Doesn't actually apply in realistic combat if you play Xiao normally \(as in plunging at the right vertical height, rather than at the limit\). Can potentially matter against enemies with hitboxes that increase Xiao's jump height. Just don't jump too high.  

---

**Finding 6:**  
Stonewall buff is based on the position of the initial cast point, not the final position of the walls. You cannot expand the buff area by using burst on an uneven location. It is also possible to obtain and lose the crit buff repeatedly by vertically entering and leaving the buff area.  

**Evidence:**  
[Video 1](https://imgur.com/C5dlvq2)  
[Video 2](https://imgur.com/v89wlNk)  

**Significance:**  
Further understanding. Supporting the overall concept of the interaction.  

---

**Finding 7:**  
Character height does not seem to affect whether or not a unit gets buffed, seemingly based on a unit's foot/standing level instead. However, character height affects a character's jump height so it can determine whether or not they receive the buff if their jump reaches the threshold.  

**Evidence:**  
Unbuffed crit rate of the following:  
GMC: 34.6%  
Zhongli: 14.3%  
Kazuha: 68.2%  
Sayu: 12%  

[Video](https://imgur.com/0WWxD25)

---

**Finding 8:**  
Standing on the meteorite does not remove the Stonewall buff. However, standing on taller geo constructs such as Zhongli's Stone Stele means losing the crit buff as it is already out of range.  

**Evidence:**  
Crit rate: 11.2% \-\> 21.2%   
[Video](https://imgur.com/C4Bn6CZ)

**Significance:**  
Rockstep and other combos that bring a character on top of the meteorite does not compromise the Stonewall buff.

### Multiple E Skill Resonance Can Hit 1 Target

**By:** The CEO of GEO\#7227

**Findings:** Resonating Geo Constructs with overlapping AoEs will multi-hit enemies

**Evidence:** *Twitch Clip lost to the sands of time*

**Significance:** Geo MC can make the most constructs on the game \(2 Meatballs which cap to 3 with Zhong Pillar, and 4 from Ult which don't count towards cap. This can turn small arenas into multi-hitting funzones.

**Finding:**  
Geo Traveler can trigger Mistsplitter NA Stack with Frenzied Rockslide (A4).

**Evidence:**  
[Youtube](https://youtu.be/YzFQnlViilI): Geo Traveler starts with 12% Geo Damage Bonus, and after procing A4, goes up to 20% Geo Damage Bonus.

**Finding:**  
It is possible for Geo Traveler to jump directly from the ground to the top of the meteorite created by Starfell Sword \(E\), giving characters vertical advantage and allowing certain actions such as plunge attacks. This mechanic can also be used by other characters in the party.  

**Evidence:**  
* Basics:
    * [Rockstep](https://imgur.com/Hwqb8ng)
    * [Extended demo](https://imgur.com/0fMSoxw)
* This tech can also be used by other characters with better plunge multipliers:  
    * [Rockstep Swap: Noelle](https://imgur.com/mtTFyzo)
    * [Rockstep Swap: Extended Demo](https://imgur.com/IQhnQKD)
* Other variations follow the same principle of using the meteorite to obtain vertical advantage:  
    * [Rockstep: Reverse Plunge](https://imgur.com/pOLMBYd)  
    * [Rockstep: Calculated](https://imgur.com/zpTl4aE)
* Another variation follows up after using the rock as a shield from enemy attacks (such as ruin guard missiles). Do note that character height affects this one; the taller a character, the easier it is to perform.
    * [Rockstep: Phantom](https://imgur.com/uchHBjw)
    * [Extended demo](https://imgur.com/MY1epe1)
* It can have some fun applications too!
    * [GMC on Fire](https://imgur.com/QIzK4LH)
    * [Rockstep: Itto](https://imgur.com/8ApH0nb)
    * [Rockstep: Klee](https://imgur.com/SbT1b2b)
* More practical applications can include using the vertical advantage to force certain enemy actions.
    * [Mitachurl drops shield](https://imgur.com/usTvkF2)
    * [Ruin Hunter takes flight](https://imgur.com/pzZ9nU5)

**Significance:**  
This is a GMC\-specific tech that can be used by other characters. There's potential gain for characters that benefit from having vertical advantage over the enemies, and doing so can trigger certain enemy patterns that may be beneficial to the player.
