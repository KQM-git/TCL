## Attack Mechanics

## Skill Mechanics

* Navia generates 3-4 particles per full charged Ceremonial Crystalshot use with no ICD, the distribution appears to be a 50/50 split. - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EshdlOw0Mss) - @soul_fish
* Navia's Skill hit box starts from slightly behind her back. - [Youtube](https://youtu.be/Ebm9aiTkSrM) - @mgr_

## Burst Mechanics

* Navia's Burst is dynamic. - @shampoobrain
  * [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaLZcRwKqKc)
  * Initially, Navia's burst does 755 damage. After receiving the 4pc TotM buff, it goes up to 812 damage, and then back down to 755 when the buff runs out.
* Navia fires 1 Cannon Fire Support approx every 0.75 seconds, and a total of 17 shots over 12 seconds, for 1+17 hits total (including the activation). - [Youtube](https://youtu.be/7vcgw1lToMw) - @soul_fish

## Ascension Mechanics
### Ascension 1: Undisclosed Distribution Channels
* Navia's A1 infusion persists on swap. - [Youtube](https://youtu.be/XQQ0THzt3zY) - @clevernt
* Navia N3 snapshots the geo infusion portion of her A1, but not the dmg%. - [Youtube](https://youtu.be/s9anTH5cSjY) - @aftermathrar
* Navia N3 -> Swap during A1 duration does keep dmg% as expected. [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1stKhTH.mp4) - @aftermathrar

## Constellation Mechanics

## Synergies/Interactions

* Navia's Elemental Burst follows the character. This allows Sorush to take it to enemies without Navia being aggro'd. - [Youtube](https://youtu.be/9rKWnX1e2e4) - @.whalien
* One of Navia's idle animations pushes mob loot away from her. This push acts only on items that begin within a radius of Navia. - [Youtube](https://youtu.be/pOCvGMAOfOo) - @.whalien
