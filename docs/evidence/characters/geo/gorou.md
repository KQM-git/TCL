  * Elemental Burst: Initial Hit [1GU](https://youtu.be/qkBwZtagqKo), Crystal Collapse 1GU
* ICDs - Nass008\#8577
  * CA: Gorou fully-charged CA has no ICD/the ICD is shorter than fastest possible CA shots - [BowTae\#0141](https://youtu.be/NFpvCqMJiBM)
  * Skill: 1s. - [EE less than 1s apart](https://youtu.be/rBKZPjxivzM) / [EE more than 1s apart](https://youtu.be/Gj8RIKWs-Vk) - Bobrokrot\#0111
  * Burst: 1. initial hit and crystal collapse have separate ICD. Crystal Collapse follows normal ICD (2.5s) - [Nass008\#8577](https://youtu.be/oOMcBCHDC-Q)
* Particles
  * Elemental Skill: Gorou produces 2 geo particles on Elemental Skill cast. (I hope 7 tests is enough, ping pong me if it isn't and/or you get something other than 2 particles. - [Neptunya\#8291](https://youtu.be/QHq1Y_-asIw)
* Unlike most characters, Gorou does not keep one eye closed after ARCC. - [BowTae\#0141](https://youtu.be/_yuZ4lKpdKY)

## Normal Attack Mechanics

* Gorou can do the following aim tech - BowTae\#0141
  * Instant RR (enter and exit aim mode in 1 frame): [Youtube](https://youtu.be/mXEXYo7BGUA)
  * Hold M1 Double CA: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/c2cWS7KNOeI)
* Unlike most characters, Gorou does not keep one eye closed after ARCC (Yoimiya also does not). - [BowTae\#0141](https://youtu.be/_yuZ4lKpdKY)

### Gorou Instant N1

**Finding:**  
Gorou N1 will come out even if canceled early. Cancels include jump, dash, skill, and most notably, aim mode. This allows controller players to abuse Gorou N1RR to high speeds, without requiring frame perfect inputs, as is the case with ARCC. To do this, press and release Attack, then enter and exit Aim mode. Repeat. Make sure you have released attack before pressing Aim.   

Unlike ARCC, these shots are Normal Attacks. In ARCC, the character shoots Charged Attacks.  

An early video dating back to Dec 2021 that I found from SaltyPotato: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/B8urJsvnZag)  
Other sources include this video from SystksjSonic: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SystksjSonic/status/1562011142645751809)

* [Dash](https://imgur.com/wMG0q1l)
* [Skill](https://imgur.com/5S200Ky)
* [Aim](https://youtu.be/ZeI8K-hnWw8)

**Significance:**  
This tech is superior to ARCC in almost every way, as it doesn't require frame perfect inputs, can be done very fast without macros, and will also trigger abilities such as Fischl C6 and Yelan Burst. This tech makes Gorou potentially the strongest physical bow character. The downside is that it only works on Gorou.  

## Skill Mechanics

* Gorou himself count for E buff condition. [Nass008\#8577](https://youtu.be/xQGDyQXzcxc)
* Gorou E and Q initial hit don't get the benefit of its own buff - [Nass008\#8577](https://youtu.be/lHvJM0ZFG4k)
* Gorou's E is unaffected by gravity. - [Aevean Leeow\#1362](https://youtu.be/ghbP5_aQwFQ)
* Gorou's zone has a delay before applying the buff (like Bennett's Q), the character receives the buff when the paw appears above their head - [Frost--Flame\#2563](https://youtu.be/n6-GLEQXT6g)

## Burst Mechanics

* Gorou's Crystal Collapse damage from his Elemental Burst doesn't snapshot. [Neptunya\#8291](https://youtu.be/DiPTvYLHR1A)
* Gorou E and Q initial hit don't get the benefit of its own buff - [Nass008\#8577](https://youtu.be/lHvJM0ZFG4k)
* Q initial hit (and A4 on initial hit) benefits from A1, but not Q buff, while Q collapse (and A4 on collapse) can benefit from A1 and Q buff. - [MeCrush14\#2271](https://youtu.be/lHvJM0ZFG4k) ([Stats](https://imgur.com/gZjNPRF))
* Gorou's Q buff lingers for 2 extra seconds. - [Vess\#7650](https://youtu.be/rsSJH9yUrOg)

### Gorou Buff Activation And Tickrate

**By:** Kolibri\#7675, Aftermath\#7658  
**Added:** <Version date="2022-09-08" \>  
**Last tested:** <Version date="2022-09-08" \>  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/gorou-buff-activation-and-tickrate)

**Finding:**  
Through a mix of in-game testing and datamine info, Gorou's timing for his buffs when using Q are as follows:  
* Gorou's A1/C6 activate on hitmark \(frame 30\).
* Gorou's field tickrate applies every 0.3s \(17-18f\) thereafter.
  
**Evidence:**  
Recordings were tested with macros to get consistent frame counts. Timing was done using the start of Gorou's animation as frame 1 to eliminate input delay discrepancies. Timing stopped on the frame the game paused when going into the menu.  
  
* [A1 timing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiwcqT7zfLM)
  * 2 trials showing that frame 29 has no A1 and frame 30 does. Small sample size, but aligns with recordings/documentation I've done previously.
  * This lines up with the hitmark of Gorou's Q. C6 is assumed to activate here as well, since it reads similarly to the A1.
* [Field tickrate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQi_6y37_q8)
  * First application on Gorou on frame 48.
  * 3 trials testing which frame the flat DEF is applied to Gorou. Frame 47 has only the A1 buff, while frame 48 has both parts.
* [Second application \(on character swap\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5rgPsyXV0E)
  * 4 trials of casting Q, then swapping immediately to another character to see when the Flat DEF is applied next. It seems consistent on frame 65/66, but the character needs to be on field for at least 1 frame before the buff is applied \(may need to test using a different buffering method in a low ping environment\).
  * After finding these frames and talking to kolibri, he said that the game data has the tickrate as 0.3s. This timing lines up well with the videos above, but shows that there is a small delay from when the Q hitmark is applied and when the field timer begins.
* [Image](https://i.imgur.com/xNMj3I3.png) of a table of the trials I recorded for the session. Some of the swap testing was done at low ping.
  
**Significance:**  
Better understanding of Gorou's buff application to snapshot the full DEF bonus for characters that can snapshot it.  

## Ascension Mechanics

### A1: Heedless of the Wind and Weather

* Gorou's **Heedless of the Wind and Weather** (A1) only scales off of base defense stat. A1 will not scale off of additional defense values gained from artifacts and/or skills. [Trosalio\#0420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXI92moZFRc)

## Constellation Mechanics

### C1: Rushing Hound: Swift as the Wind

* Gorou's C1 CD eventually desyncs from his E CD, meaning you cannot proc it on every E cast. [Steno\#0119](https://imgur.com/a/yXHcZnm)
* Gorou's C1 can snapshot/Gorou's E and Q zone buff is delayed like Bennett's Q buff. To trigger C1 the character must deal geo damage while in the field, for characters with off-field abilities it just means they need to enter the zone and use the ability before going off-field.
  In the second half of the video Albedo/Zhongli's E were used before they received the buff, meaning they weren't considered to be in gorou's E at the time of casting. - [Frost--Flame\#2563](https://youtu.be/O-HGSNkj478)

### C4: Lapping Hound: Warm as Water

* Gorou's C4 does not snapshot. - [Vherax\#5321](https://youtu.be/F-iLJL_9yQk)

### C6: Valiant Hound: Mountainous Fealty

* Gorou's C6 doesn't snapshot. - [JonahFarc\#7056](https://tcl-backup.s3.filebase.com/evidence/characters/geo/gorou.md/discord/attachments_912910214699819028_921103967428182076_2021-12-16_12-09-26.mp4) ([Stats](https://tcl-backup.s3.filebase.com/evidence/characters/geo/gorou.md/discord/attachments_912910214699819028_921103969521115136_unknown.png))
