## Basic Mechanics

* Frame data - [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1buBVBvlgfNcRA09XA3BLm-oA7hpCVRYkGt_7kPBYJu0/edit?usp=sharing) - Kurt\#5846 & Kolibri\#7675
* Rosaria's E is 1U Cryo on both hits and has [no ICD](https://imgur.com/vpy8JVR)
* Rosaria's Q applies 1U Cryo on every damage tick with [no ICD](https://imgur.com/jwQ4MTn)
* Rosaria's CRIT bonus from her A1 is included in her [A4 CRIT sharing](https://imgur.com/Gvmc6pN)
* Rosaria's A1 CRIT bonus doesn't apply if you use her E while already [behind an enemy](https://imgur.com/Ye5ro0C)

## Ascension Mechanics

### Passive: Night Walk

#### Rosaria's passive doesn't work in the Serenitea Pot

**Finding:**  
Rosaria's passive does not work in serenitea pot (even after manual time switch to night time).

**Evidence:**  
Overworld: Clearly faster - [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ih1R1EC.mp4)
Serenitea Pot - [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MS4UUSn.mp4)

**Significance:**  
Another evidence that the Serenitea Pot behaves similarly to Domains in game.

### A1: Regina Probationum

#### Rosaria's A1 Passive vs. Perpetual Mechanical Array & the Hypostases

**Finding:**  
Although Hypostases and Perpetual Mechanical Array don’t have obvious distinction between front and back in terms of visual, Rosaria can still activate her A1 Passive (12% CRIT Rate buff) by hitting them from certain angles.

**Evidence:**

* [Video](https://youtu.be/dig5i2_D3K0)  
  In this clip I cast Rosaria E twice against Cryo Hypostasis in the same DPS window. The first E failed to activate A1 while the second E cast from opposite direction was able to activate it.

* [Video](https://youtu.be/zOOQLVVu7D4)  
  This clip contains two separate attempts of hitting Cryo Hypostasis after they performed the rolling attacks. In the first attempt, I hit them from “behind” and successfully activated the passive. In the second attempt I hit them from opposite direction and couldn’t get the buff.

* Clips of Rosaria getting A1 buff against other bosses:  
  Anemo Hypostasis - [Video](https://youtu.be/BWp5TEI-orQ)  
  Electro Hypostasis - [Video](https://youtu.be/rRiCoKKL8h8)  
  Geo Hypostasis - [Video](https://youtu.be/gF8e_XSGxH0)  
  Pyro Hypostasis - [Video](https://youtu.be/wFwCQRupHXs)  
  Perpetual Mechanical Array - [Video](https://youtu.be/WI1RgjQoGNE)

**Significance:**  
Rosaria can take advantage of her A1 Passive against the aforementioned bosses by the correct positioning. Which can be useful especially when these enemies appear in harder contents such as Spiral Abyss/Event Domains.

#### Rosaria Skill First Hit A1 Crit Buff

**Finding:**  
Rosaria's A1 passive does apply to the first hit of her skill  
  
**Evidence:**  
[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fH0tXxjDc0Ymk8DKfv6x2OYnz9wBGYNBu_GSP1XBY_4/edit?usp=sharing,) sheet where I recorded all my Rosaria Es. 55 Rosaria Es were tested and all of them crit. If the A1 Crit Rate doesn't apply to her E then there would be a 0.0018% chance of this happening. I did a Chi Squared test with the expected values being if the A1 passive didn't apply and got a p-value of .0095 meaning its statistically significant  
Videos of me doing the Rosaria Es:

[YouTube](https://youtu.be/d46XoSH-_yY)  
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/45n9hHeaOI4)  
  
**Significance:**  
Rosaria's skill snapshot before the first hit of her skill and since her CR applies to it she can do marginally more damage. This also doesn't match with the wording of her ascension which implies that it'll apply only after the first hit of the skill.

### A4: Shadow Samaritan

#### A4 Stacks with External Sources of CRIT

**By:** The Immersive Fish\#9373  
**Added:** <Version date="2021-04-09" />  
**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2021-04-09" />

**Finding:**  
Rosaria's CRIT Rate sharing is influenced by other direct CRIT boosters.

This has been tested to work with Hu Tao's A1 and Geo MC's C1.

**Evidence:** [YouTube](https://youtu.be/TmSbqoUg0k0)

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="stats" label="Stats">
Diona : 29.9%  
Rosaria A4 : + 8.8%

Diona w/ Rosaria A4 : 38.7%  
Diona w/ Hu Tao A1 : 41.9%

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

While the Hu Tao boost is active, Ulting with Rosaria increases Diona's CR to **52.5%** meaning that Rosaria's A4 is giving Diona **10.6%** CR. This is an **additional 1.8% CR** when compared to the CRIT sharing uninfluenced by Hu Tao.

**Significance:**  
This confirms that anything which influences a character's CRIT stats found in the details tab will influence the CRIT Sharing that Rosaria offers

## Constellation Mechanics

### C6: Divine Retribution

#### Rosaria's C6 Debuff Refreshes on Hit

**By:** Zendaju\#3064  
**Added:** <Version date="2021-04-15" />  
**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2021-04-15" />

**Finding:**  
Rosaria's C6 debuff is also triggered by the DoT on her Burst.

**Evidence:**  
[Video](https://tcl-backup.s3.filebase.com/evidence/characters/cryo/rosaria.md/discord/attachments_831212714416144434_831214571913347112_Genshin_Impact_2021-04-12_11-51-59_Trim.mp4)

**Significance:**  
The description is misleading, and you can actually maintain 100% uptime on this Physical RES Shred.

## Interactions/Synergies

### Pale Flame on Rosaria

**By:** Monado\#9922  
**Added:** <Version date="2021-05-01" />  
**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2021-05-01" />

**Finding:**  
2 stacks of the Pale Flame 4-Piece set bonus cannot be achieved by 1 use of Rosaria's Skill despite the Skill being 2 hits \(probably because the 2 hits are within 0.3s\), and requires back to back usage to achieve the full 4-Piece effect.

**Evidence:**  
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPQqnZv0qLk)  
Also hitlag on Mitachurl shields [wooden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jd4QWFFavY) and [geo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klxD_F9Widg) still only grants you one stack per Skill use.

**Significance:**  
This makes 4-Piece Pale Flame stacks somewhat difficult to maintain for carry Rosaria with, since her Skill CD is 6s and Pale Flame stacks last for 7s.
