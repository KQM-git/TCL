* Snapshotting:
  * E: Each individual Shooting Star snapshots when it launches. - [Bobrokrot\#0111](https://youtu.be/ESqDyFZi50A)
  * Q: Snapshots when the Celestial Dreamsphere is created. - [Bobrokrot\#0111](https://youtu.be/ESqDyFZi50A)

## Skill Mechanics

* Layla has a 30% chance of making 2 particles per proc, and a 70% chance of making 1 particle (based on 71 procs). More testing would be useful to determine if it's actually 33.333% - [Zakharov\#5645](https://youtu.be/GVEUqNpfECE)
* If Layla casts her E while there is a Curtain of Slumber active, either from CD reduction or reset, the new shield won't reset the stars gained but will extend them. - [emmaus\#9072](https://youtu.be/tTY8FMSF9CU)
* Certain characters, if used correctly, can "use" an Elemental Skill twice so that Layla generates extra Night Stars. - [Bobrokrot\#0111](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw9iv6ZYLIFlB6iw3MUhzWqT59k64aED_)
  * Yelan: releasing E after holding it is considered as another Elemental Skill use.
  * Sayu:  pressing E again after holding it.
  * Tartaglia: manually exiting from melee stance.
  * Fischl: repositioning Oz.
  * Mona: E can be canceled but still be considered as skill use.
  * Keqing: counts twice when the double tap version is used, but the Charged Attack version only counts once. - [Char11\#6024](https://youtu.be/4kaLn4Rln6M)
    * It seems that Layla's shield gains stars on the actual action of pressing the E button.
    * It is also possible to throw out Keqing's Stiletto first, then switch to cast Layla's E, then switch back to recast Keqing's Skill for 1 count of Elemental Skill.
  * Skills that do not count as extra skill uses: parries (Beidou, Yun Jin, Candace), Nahida hold E, Anemo MC hold E.
* Layla's stars, from both her shield and Burst, will always target the nearest entity. If they start shooting and you move out of range of a target, the remaining stars will fly to the last target that was in range. - [Targeting behavior and range](https://youtu.be/Q_s-hnclMcw) - [Target Range behavior](https://youtu.be/89ctFX451gA) - [Target change](https://youtu.be/anzeKMQ-JLo) - emmaus\#9072

## Ascension Mechanics

### A1: Like Nascent Light

* The shield strength from Layla's A1 transfers to the character on-field. - [pweep\#0150 & Chronopolize\#6513](https://youtu.be/EtaiPudAXHg)
* Layla's A1 and her Shooting Stars don't reset when you refresh her shield. - [pweep\#0150 & Chronopolize\#6513](https://youtu.be/e-nc1exfRIU)
* Layla's A1 passive (shield strength) doesn't reset even if her shield resets. - [pweep\#0150](https://youtu.be/ReuurbVWizY)
