## Basic Mechanics

* Frame data - [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11f_FxKhXFpL4EHSfFHPPjhXJvVOTi-FP_R6cqaZ9dwo/edit?usp=sharing) - Kolibri\#7675

## Skill Mechanics

### Kaeya E Energy Trials

**By:** Ayzel\#7399  
**Added:** <Version date="2021-05-22" />  
**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2021-05-22" />  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/ticket-archive/attachments_845440342446571550_845488049831542784_transcript-kaeya-e-energy-trials.html)

**Finding:** Kaeya generates Particles between 2-3 \(4-5 if accounting for ascension talent\) at a 1:2 ratio, not a 1:1 ratio.

**Evidence:** [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B9PoD7YlKWPoXBpsIc2fARw9zSml-gWQtSoNd3fr7z8/edit?usp=sharing)

**Methodology:** I used Kaeya's Skill 59 times and averaged the number of Particles dropped per Skill usage, which averaged out to 2.677.

**Significance:** Kaeya gens more Energy than in TCL, which probably changes ER requirements for quite a lot of teams \(including Eula\).

## Burst Mechanics

### Glacial Waltz Proc Frames and Interactions

**Finding:**  
Kaeya’s Glacial Waltz (non-c6) has an enemy-independent lock that lasts at least 75f or 1.2s. I constantly observe the icicles proccing about 75-100f since their last proc. This is true regardless if the hitboxes come from the same enemy (B-1) or different (B-2). This means that the locks are specific to icicles and independent of enemy. The timing is more variable than Xiangling’s Pyrnado, but this could be due to funky Glacial Waltz hitboxes, which is beyond the scope of what I’m trying to do.

**Evidence:**

* [Kaeya Glacial Waltz procs standing surrounded by Cryo Regisvine](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QpaoDEwA1NE)
* [Kaeya Glacial Waltz procs surrounded by Ruin Guards](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbfwWboedA)
* [Google Sheet containing all the frame counts mentioned](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14FzSNVsEFG6wg1oDt49b8vPr_zjmKzRJsAQ2VC71OIc/edit).

**Significance:**  
These data sheds light onto Glacial Waltz mechanics and how to maximize their Burst damage. It also explains how moving around an enemy in the opposite direction of the rotation can increase damage of both bursts. However, you should not move too fast or else the enemy hit box loses contact with your Burst before the lock expires.

## Ascension Mechanics

### A4: Glacial Heart

#### Kaeya A4 Energy

**By:** Kolibri\#7675  
**Added:** <Version date="2021-12-30" />  
**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2021-12-30" />

**Finding:** The amount of additional Particles generated by Kaeya's A4 depends on the number of enemies hit. Hitting 1 enemy generates 1 additional Particle and hitting 2 (or more) enemies generates 2 additional Particles.

**Evidence:**

* 1 enemy Frozen by Kaeya's E: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/1BB04ufgR6o)  
  3-4 Particles were generated in total.
* 2 enemies Frozen by Kaeya's E: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/nRTbBIqvinY)  
  4-5 Particles were generated in total.

**Significance:**

* The Energy gained from Kaeya's A4 is worse in single-target resulting in a higher ER requirement.
* Aiming Kaeya's E to hit multiple enemies at once in Freeze comps helps with his Energy generation.

#### Kaeya A4 Procs on Frozen Targets

**By:** JonahFarc\#7056  
**Added:** <Version date="2021-04-19" />  
**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2021-04-19" />

**Findings:** Kaeya's A4 is phrased as "Opponents Frozen by **Frostgnaw** will drop additional Elemental Particles." However, enemies don't actually have to be Frozen by his Elemental Skill for the additional Particles to be generated; as long as Kaeya's Skill hits a Frozen enemy, it will generate additional Elemental Particles.

**Evidence:** [Barbara freezes target and Kaeya uses his E afterwards. 4 Particles are received, which can only come from his A4 Passive.](https://youtu.be/RiTTnpQ44DA)

**Significance:** With Freeze comps, you can basically just E whenever you want and still get the additional Particles without having to make sure Kaeya's the trigger

#### Kaeya A4 vs Enemies That Can Not be Frozen

**Finding:**  
Kaeya’s A4 does not work on Boss and Trounce Domain enemies, works on Cryo Abyss Mage.

**Evidence:**  
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/jjqj4A6)
Kaeya’s Elemental Skill generates 2-3 Particles when hitting Boss and Trounce Domain enemies inflicted with Hydro and generates 4 Particles when hitting a Cryo Abyss Mage inflicted with Hydro. Testings cannot be done on Thunder Manifestation and Stormterror, the former due to inherent Electro aura and the latter due to weird interactions with Hydro preventing Cryo from triggering the Frozen status.

**Significance:**  
Further understanding of Particle generation.

## Constellation Mechanics

### C2: Never-Ending Performance

#### Anyone can Trigger C2 Extension

**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2022-07-29" />  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/kaeya-c2-anyone-trigger)

**Finding:**  
Unlike how it is worded, Kaeya C2 does not care if his Burst or himself that deals the final blow; Anyone can deal the final blow, and the extension still happens.

**Evidence:**  
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVOcNeMFqb0)

**Significance:**  
Clarification for C2 trigger condition. C2 is easier to trigger than the ingame wording suggests.
