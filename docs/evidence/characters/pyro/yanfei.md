**Finding:**  
Yanfei's Charged Attack Stamina consumption is reduced by 15% per seal. Yanfei's C1 makes each of her seal reduce Stamina cost of her Charged Attacks by and additional 10%. Her C6 allows her to have an extra 1 seal for a max of 4. 4 seals, each giving 25% Stamina reduction each results in her Charged Attacks not costing stamina. Video proof attached, first Charged Attack with 0 seals consumes Stamina and causes bar to appear, second Charged Attack with full seals after gaining them through Yanfei's E does not.

**Evidence:** [Video](https://youtu.be/S3SkDNAuwzc)

**Significance:**  
With a play style heavily centered around charge attacks, Yanfei's C6 allowing her to have 0 Stamina cost per Charged Attack makes her C6 very useful.
