* Deprecated frame data:
  * E-reduced CA level 2 - 30 \(38 with recovery\) - BowTae#0141(count), [flamescion#9370](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG-hT06nSG0)
  * Q - 116 - [Zakharov#5645](https://youtu.be/jZNdJEjbJUQ)
* Gauges
  * CA Lv.1, CA Lv. 2 Wreath Arrow, CA Lv. 2 Clusterbloom Arrow, E and Q : 1U - [Kolibri#7675](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhUVsQKUGis)
* ICD
  * CA Lv.1 and CA Lv.2 Wreath Arrow have no ICD, CA Lv.2 Clusterbloom Arrow have 2.5s/4 Hits ICD. - [Zakharov#5645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZNdJEjbJUQ) 
  * C6 Additional CLusterbloom Arrow has no ICD. - [Wüolf#3334](https://youtu.be/7LZAN_K2eZg)
  * E has no ICD and Q Tanglevine Shaft and Secondary Tanglevine Shaft DMG have normal ICD. - [Zakharov#5645](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZNdJEjbJUQ) 
* Snapshot - [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M2nTLogzYd2o4ZLkYEkzfovwiTznQOB5ujWuMlQbE0k/edit?usp=sharing) - Bobrokrot#0111
  * Tighnari's E snapshots on activation. [Video](https://youtu.be/NILZic2btMk)
  * Tighnari's Q Tanglevine Shaft snapshots when arrows are fired but the Q secondary Tanglevine Shaft is either dynamic or snapshots at individual times when they are created. [Video](https://youtu.be/3ofPtiemJqk)
  * Tighnari's Wreath Arrow snapshots and Clustebloom arrows are either dynamic or snapshots at individual times when they are created. [Video](https://youtu.be/ZMowzpLubVc)

## Attack Mechanics

* Clusterbloom arrows have a small aoe with a radius of 1m. - [Video](https://youtu.be/7cPd0ySqmUI) - f̸̒͂ỏ̶̂o̵͌̚s̶͊̏h̷̤̀ḯ̴̊#9920
* Tighnari’s Clusterblooms have a max range before they disappear. - [Video](https://youtu.be/nXZ0qsLbfco) - Wüolf#3334
* If there is no target in range, clusterbloom arrows target where the wreath arrow hit. If there is a target in range, it prioritizes enemies over objects, even if the wreath arrow hits the object. If there are multiple targets, it only targets one of them. - [Video](https://youtu.be/WsiBn6Wzk78) - flamescion#9370
* Clusterbloom arrows move in an upward and backward trajectory before homing towards the target. This can make them hit other objects like walls etc. - [Video](https://youtu.be/6rJq2vqFJHo) - flamescion#9370

## Skill Mechanics

* Tighnari's E snapshot at activation. - [Video](https://youtu.be/NILZic2btMk) - Bobrokrot#0111
* Tighnari's E produces 3-4 particles at a ratio of 1:1. - [Video](https://youtu.be/9rDMqveXeT8) - flamescion#9370
* The fastest that Tighnari's E-CA-CA-CA combo can be executed using a macro is 2:25 seconds, for a total of 145 frames. - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG-hT06nSG0) - flamescion#9370
* Tighnari E-CA-CA-CA takes roughly 3 seconds when done by a typical player. - [Video](https://youtu.be/iTZ1ISVK75M) - Zakharov#5645

## Burst Mechanics

* Doing E - CA before Q (C0) allows you to catch particles during burst. - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6ibUnVWmzc) - flamescion#9370
* Doing E - CA before Q allows you to catch particles during burst - [Video](https://youtu.be/q6ibUnVWmzc) - flamescion#9370

## Ascension Mechanics

### A1: Keen Sight

* Tighnari's A1 does not stack. - [Video](https://youtu.be/ZR9IaTEzlBs) - flamescion#9370

### A4: Scholarly Blade

* Tighnari A4 Benefit From Percentage Based Em Buffs. - [Video](https://youtu.be/8B1b_RBUpt0) - Mr. Pillow\#0065  

### Hunter's passive and Tighnari A4 Benefit From Percentage Based Em Buffs

**By:** Mr. Pillow\#0065  
**Added:** 2022-10-14  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/hunters-passive-and-tighnari-a4-benefit-from-percentage-based-em-buffs)

**Finding:**  
Hunter's passive and Tighnari A4 benefit from percentage-based EM buffs.  
  
**Evidence:**  
* Videos:
  * [YouTube](https://youtu.be/8B1b_RBUpt0)
  * [YouTube](https://youtu.be/B5Tk_QpyO_Y)  
* In the first video and the second video Tighnari hits twice with his Level 1 Aimed Shot and twice with his Elemental Burst, respectively, once before and once after Sucrose has triggered her A4. The attached calculations show that the passive of Hunter's Path and Tighnari A4 (both the CA DMG% and Burst DMG% part) benefit from Sucrose A4.  
  
**Significance:**  
Confirmation that the bugfix introduced with the 3.1 update "Fixes an issue whereby effects gained based on a character's attribute were incorrectly increased" ([genshin.hoyoverse.com](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/2428)) is actually true. Better knowledge of how percentage-based effects work.

## Constellation Mechanics

### C6: Karma Adjudged From the Leaden Fruit

* Tighnari C6 CA deals 3 Instances of Spread. [Video](https://youtu.be/7LZAN_K2eZg) - Wüolf#3334
  * Significance: Tighnari’s C6 Additional Clusterbloom has no ICD.
* Tighnari C6 E->CA works with BowTae ARCC. - [Video](https://youtu.be/jWCpmgLob60) and [Video](https://youtu.be/kshgOpyCbAw) - Wüolf#3334
* Doing an ARCC C6 CA in between E and Q would still let Tighnari get generated particles during his burst - [Video](https://youtu.be/4m9d5rJAlj0) - Wüolf#3334
  * Significance: A1 passive can be triggered for 50 extra em before using his burst while also getting particles back.
