**Finding:**  
According to some Talent, Constellation, weapon, and artifact descriptions, the ability is triggered when the character scores a hit. Some descriptions say that they work even if the character is off-field, however, for all the descriptions that do not say, it is quite inconsistent and depends on which one it is.  

**Evidence:**  
[Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S_Toll_6qIO1q2ood0KPteVH0-lw3mAPTKqEkmJeo9U/edit?usp=sharing)  

**Significance:**  
On-hit does not always mean on-field.
