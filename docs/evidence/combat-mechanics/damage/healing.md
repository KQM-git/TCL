**Finding:**  
Outgoing and incoming healing bonuses are additive.

**Evidence:**  
[Video](https://youtu.be/yJMPaWKCCbA) Barbara with 9419 health, level 7 Skill, 4-Piece maidens, and Hydro resonance. Assuming outgoing and incoming are additive, Barbara would heal for `((9419 * 0.06) + 664) * (1 + 0.15 + 0.20 + 0.30) = 2028.081` which video confirms.

**Significance:**  
The two are additive.
