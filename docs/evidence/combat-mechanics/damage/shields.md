[Update](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/update-for-shield-and-i-frame-interaction)

**Finding:**  
Gaining i-frames by dashing through enemy attacks will allow both your unit and their shield to take no damage, but using an Elemental Burst to gain i-frames will only make your unit took no damage, while their shield will still take damage. As of version 3.2, shields would not take any damage if character is in i-frame.

**Significance:**  
Better knowledge of how to preserve shields and how shields interact with i-frames.

## Damage Reduction Applies Before Shields Are Calculated

**By:** Faranight\#0001

**Finding:**

Damage reduction applies before shields are calculated.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**

**Shields are more effective on characters with high defense.**

## How Elemental Shields having 250% Absorption Bonus to said element Work

**By:** TÃ¼rin\#8565

**E/N: Submission demonstrates the above mentioned effect using the example of Diona but this also holds true for other similar character-generated shields.**

**Theory:**

With Cryo Absorption Bonus, Diona takes 2.5 points of Cryo Damage for every 1 point of Shield HP lost.

**Evidence:**

My original math is in the description of the video. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk41KCMjfCI&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk41KCMjfCI&feature=youtu.be)

**Significance:**

Other shield effectiveness is not accounted for, but it stands to reason that they work the same way. We can both say that a shield has 2.5x of its current value, or the damage is reduced by 2.5x, against it's effective element.
