## In-Depth Look at Monster Skill Effects in Domains/Abyss

**By:** Steno\#6940

**Finding:**  
In-depth look at monster Skill effects in abyss/domains \(Ice Cage, Pursuing Fireball, etc.\)

Note: Since the official names for these are incredibly difficult to find, I will list them here

* Ice Cage
* Vacuum Vortex
* Rumbling Stone
* Lightning Stake
* Pursuing Fireball
* Mist Bubble

[Source](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/9368)

1\) Monster Skill effects deal flat damage. The amount of damage dealt scales similarly to transformative reactions \(thanks to @Carrier5by5 for looking into this\), based purely off a base multiplier corresponding to each Skill effect \(for example, **Ice Cage** deals twice as much damage as **Rumbling Stone**\). These multipliers can be found [here](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Elements#Damage_Abilities_2). Also, the damage is unaffected by your character level or defense; it will always deal the same amount of damage regardless.

2\) The damage from monster Skill effects cannot be reduced by Skills like **Xingqiu's E/Q** and **Beidou's Q**. This means that comps like **Beidou Xingqiu** Electro-charge that can usually tank enemy attacks by stacking damage reduction cannot tank these effects easily.

3\) The damage from monster Skill effects is affected by character resistance.

[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElFNtz8QrnU) \(Tested with a lvl 21 Razor with and without 2-Piece lavawalkers set\)

4\) The damage from monster Skill effects can be shielded. This also means that while the damage can be shielded, damage reduction Skills that normally reduce the amount of shield damage taken will not apply.

[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9THhkkdFwY)

5\) Monster Skill effects can be taunted. In general, these Skill effects target the same thing that the corresponding monster is also targeting. In some cases the target will "snapshot" \(i.e. if the monster changes its target during the effect, the effect will not update\) and in other cases it will not. Seems to be inconsistent.

[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEPVPyj-Vl0)

Monster Skill effects spawn at fixed intervals, specific to each type:

* Ice Cage: 12.5 seconds
* Vacuum Vortex: unknown \(its not in the game rn\)
* Rumbling Stone: 15 seconds
* Lightning Stake: 12.5 seconds
* Pursuing Fireball: 20 seconds
* Mist Bubble: 12.5 seconds

**Significance:**

Overall useful information for people looking to clear abyss/domains

## Mist Bubble

### Mist Bubble I-Frame

**Finding:**  
The bubble from the Hydro Abyss Mages and their Hydro bubble spawning mechanic can be effectively i-framed by swapping characters at the precise moment. However, the Hydro bubble will persist on the character that was initially hit for approximately 5 seconds

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
Dash i-frames do not always work against the bubbles, especially for the abyss mage ones which home onto the character even after iframing through it. While the character initially hit still takes damage from the bubble, the dangerous CC effect of the bubble can be ignored, which makes dealing with the bubbles without ult i-frames a lot easier.

### CO-OP Hydro Abyss Mage Bubble

## Black Aura Data

**Findings:**  
This entry was opened to know the values of the black auras you can find in abyss and Inazuma bounties, which release a shockwave of a random Element (although, just like with Geovishaps, this Element is already determined before the battle even starts), so far, only Hydro, Electro and Cryo black auras have appeared in the game.

Research made in-game proved that these black auras has the following properties:

Cooldown: 15s  
Gauge Units it inflicts: 2  
Multiplier: 400%  
Element: Depends (usually matches the Element of the black aura's holder)

These properties are shared across the 3 black auras.

Furthermore, a compilation of the damage dealt by auras can be seen in this [Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UyyuBOzdM3yJiJaSIlkz6SD148gg5tjOaXQYTkZ_PWs/edit?usp=sharing).

Where black numbers are values that were seen in-game (if they have a "?", it's because there is a possibility it might be a bit off), and red ones are just speculative based on the multipliers we got. This doc shows how the level of the enemy matters when it comes to the aura's power.

Note: Inazuma bounties seem to be an exception, as both Tier 2 and Tier 3 bounties have lvl 88 auras, while the enemies are lvl 91 and 96 respectively.

**Evidence:**  
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioADUvIrhUM)

How was all of this tested?  
After seeing several factors that could affect the result, such as the Protective Canopy's 15% Elemental RES, all values in the doc were compiled by visiting all domains in Teyvat and taking damage several times with different characters and Anemo resonance, all of this while avoiding Elemental reactions.  
Cooldown and Gauge Units are easy to test, as you only need a timer, and avoid getting another Element on you.  
The 400% multiplier was somewhat easy to get, as the black aura damage always matches the one dealt by the Cryo one, and since the Cryo aura has a multiplier of 400%, then black auras should too.

**Significance:**  
Early understanding about this strange **Black Aura**, now known officially as "**Discharge**"

## Targeting Ignores Enemy Hitbox Location

**Finding/Theory:**  
The targeting point for targeted Skills (which is everything except bow aim shot as far as I am aware) is not the center of the enemy hitbox. Instead, the target point is set arbitrarily per enemy per animation.

**Evidence:**  
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/hShlJ7r)

* The larger of the two new enemies for patch 2.2 can display some highly inaccurate targeting boxes, especially when Frozen. This also shows the targeting point and hitbox are separate.
* The Rifthound initiates a jump back and follow-up charge, but gets Frozen as soon as the follow up charge starts. However, Ayaka cannot damage it with her Charged Attack because the targeting point is too far away from the enemy hitbox.
* I think MiHoYo tried to fake bow normal target tracking for Rifthounds by making the targeting point in front of the enemy hitbox, instead of inside it. Unfortunately, this hack affects everything else too, and makes Ayaka whiff half her kit. R.I.P.

**Significance:**  
Some Elemental Bursts, Skills, Catalyst/Bow Normal Attacks, and special Charged Attacks can potentially whiff on Frozen enemies, resulting in a significant DPS loss.

**Finding:**  
A list of findings regarding the [Miasmic Tumor](../../../enemy-data/miscellaneous/miasmic-tumor.md#miasmic-tumor)

Behaviour:

* does laser attack at 75%, 50% and 25% HP thresholds.
* summons ochimusa at 100%, 66% and 33% HP thresholds. becomes immortal again.
* spams Orbs every 6-7 seconds after it summons the first ochimusa. they deal close to no damage, but they do deal a bit of poise damage, though it takes 2 waves of full hits to even stagger. there is a max cap on the number of Orbs. aiming is scuffed until you get close to it.

Other Interactions:

* disappears in multiplayer.
* cant have marks or statuses.
* can only have Cryo and Freeze aura. reactions with those work as normal.
* cant lower resistance.
* can switch party near it, even when being hit by the Orbs.

## Coral Defenders

### Coral Defender Orb Mechanics

**Findings:**  
The Energy burn Orbs from Coral Defenders have 1 instance of damage. This damage is made up by a Base DMG part \(which can be blocked by a shield\) and a DMG part that is based on how much excess Energy burn was dealt \(unblockable, goes through shields\). Each Orb does 30 Energy damage, if you get hit by the Orb while having less than 30 Energy, the leftover Energy burn gets converted to Elemental DMG, both the Base DMG and the excess Energy burn are affected by DEF but not by RES. The Energy burn Orbs are capable of triggering Elemental Reactions, however in case of Amplifying Reactions they will only amplify the base DMG \(blockable\) part and not the excess Energy DMG \(unblockable\) part.

**Evidence:**

* [One damage source](https://youtu.be/Ns2Uzj6sywM)
* Damage test 1: [Full health, no DEF sands](https://imgur.com/SV3ooJf)
* Damage test 2: [Damaged, no DEF sands](https://imgur.com/4dSkSTd)
* Damage test 3: [Damaged, with DEF sands](https://imgur.com/4dSkSTd)
* Damage test 4: [4 elements +15% resistance resonance, no DEF sands](https://imgur.com/m9HbEOg) \(44 less DEF than tests 1 and 2\)
* Damage test 5: [Melt, no DEF sands](https://imgur.com/zK9wlg5) \(44 less DEF than tests 1 and 2\)

**Significance:**  
It was previously assumed that the damage is based on how much HP a character has, this turns out to not be the case (no difference in damage taken between test 1 and 2). The damage actually is affected by DEF but not by RES. Melt does not increase the damage dealt by the unblockable part, which adds value to shielders such as Zhongli.

### Coral Defenders and Bathysmal Vishap Cleansing Shower HP Loss Correction

**Last tested:** <VersionHl date="2022-11-25" />  
[Discussion](https://tickets.deeznuts.moe/transcripts/watervishap-hp-drain-correction)

**Finding:**    
The HP Loss from the Coral Defenders and Bathysmal Vishaps' Cleansing Shower atack is not affected by DEF.
  
The correct calculations for the HP Loss are as follows:  
Boss:     (0.17 × Character Max HP + 600) × (1 - Remaining Energy/30)  
Non-Boss: (0.14 x Character Max HP + 200) × (1 - Remaining Energy/10)  
  
**Evidence:**  
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/BHDGmS1)  
* Venti regenerates 15 Energy from his 4th Ascension Passive. The Cleansing Shower dealt (0.17 × 18474 + 600) × (1 - 15/30) = 1870 DMG 

[Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/n9568Zy)   
* Ganyu has 122% ER, and generates 2 particles from her Skill which grants her 7.32 energy. The first Cleansing Shower dealt (0.17 × 16686 + 600) × (1 - 7.32/30) = 2598 DMG, and the second Cleansing Shower did (0.17 × 16686 + 600) × (1 - 0/30) = 3436 DMG    

[Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/NIAVKSw)  
* Ayato has 123.3% ER, and generates 1 particle from his Skill which grants him 3.699 energy. The Cleansing Shower dealt (0.14 × 25205 + 200) × (1 - 3.699/10)= 2349 DMG.  
  
**Significance:**  
Correcting misinformation in the Coral Defenders page of the TCL.

**Finding:**  
As of the time of writing this, the TCL page for Coral Defenders states that the 2 vishaps cannot use the spike field attacks at the same time. This seems to be the case for the overworld herd.

But the the herd that appeared in patch 2.5's Spiral abyss **can** do the spike field attacks at the same time, maybe not down to the second but there is definitely some overlap.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
Disambiguation of the Abyss-specific spike field overlap behavior on the enemy page.

## Golden Wolflord

### Basic Mechanics

**Findings:**

1. HP Particles/orbs:
   * 75% HP: 1 Clear Orb & 1 Clear Particle
   * 50% HP: 1 Clear Orb & 1 Clear Particle
   * 25% HP: 1 Clear Orb & 1 Clear Particle
   * On death: 1 Clear Orb & 1 Clear Particle
2. At 66% HP it spawns a shield consisting of 3 skulls around the arena.
3. Each skull requires 3U Geo or 38 Elemental attacks to be destroyed. The ICD on all Elements except for Geo will be ignored and each skull requires 38 hits regardless of the GU.
4. On hit, the Golden Wolflord applies the Corrosion status to the player, some of the attacks can be i\-framed, meaning no Corrosion is applied.
5. The dive that does damage in a large AoE can only destroy Geo Constructs that are between the skulls and the Golden Wolflord, allowing Geo Traveler's C2 to proc. But when Geo Constructs are placed between the skulls and the edge of the arena, they are invulnerable to this attack.
6. Attacks:
   * The ramming attack can be an opener. The initial action includes flying up, then do multiple spins: counter\-clockwise to clockwise to counter\-clockwise. It takes about 5 sec to finish the moveset \(starting from the flying up\). With enough tanking capabilities, you can combine the ~4 sec grounded during this moveset and the 6 sec stunned to deal more damage.
   * Tornado. It starts with twirling counter\-clockwise at the center of arena, generating wind currents, before diving and creating the "Tornado". The overall moveset lasts for ~16 sec, after which the GW will be stunned. During the tornado attack, GW is still susceptible to damage. The tornado can also get stuck on Geo Constructs.
   * Sweep. Initiated by raising its head, then sweeping/lashing clockwise using its tail with a relatively big AoE. The overall moveset lasts for ~4 sec, but is only grounded for ~2 sec.
   * Laser Beam. Starts with raising of its head a bit, its mouth glowing, before initiating the actual Laser Beam. The beam slowly rakes from an angle, until it reaches ~90 degrees, lasting for 4 sec. The beam deals continuous damage, applying corrosion at a fast rate. The overall moveset lasts for 10 sec, while also being grounded for the whole duration.
   * Skull Strike. The attack is initiated by raising its whole body above ground, then start spewing the "skulls" from its mouth, 1 skull every second. For the first two skulls, it seems the tracking starts before they were actually released, they also travel in an arc to attempt to hit the player at an angle. The third skull seems to travel overhead, also has better tracking. The skulls maybe blocked by constructs. The overall moveset lasts for 6 sec above ground.
   * Earthshaking Dive. Initiated by going into the center, and flying up, then telegraphing a big AoE covering almost the whole arena before diving below ground. The impact from diving deals damage, while the whole sequence lasts for 6 sec. After 1 sec, several AoEs are telegraphed across the room, then explodes after 2 sec, accompanied by the resurfacing of GW at the center that also deals damage. The overall moveset last for 10 sec. This moveset will be used for the first time during the Rifthound Skulls (Shielded Phase) and occasionally afterwards.
7. Stuns:
   * The stuns after the ramming attack and the tornado last 6s.
   * The stuns after the skulls are broken lasts 24s.
8. While the Golden Wolflord is flying, standing on a Geo Construct can help melee characters hit it. Deployables such as Oz, Ushi, and Yae Miko's totems can as well.
9. There is a bug where the skulls will sometimes not spawn.
10. There is another bug where sometimes Geo attacks will not deal any damage to the skulls.
11. There is yet another bug where it sometimes launches the player into the air and if you don't glide or plunge, and no fall damage is taken.
