**Findings:** You lose about 12.5% HP from taking the HP buff and resetting.

**Significance:** Could use to reduce Hu Tao HP. Also just hurts the HP pool, so can be impactful.

**Findings:** In the spiral abyss, there is a buff card that says "Character DMG within 8s of sprint +20%. Can only occur once every 15 seconds.". It came to my attention that it remains unknown to some people that if you sprint to the key before starting the chamber, the buff's timer starts ticking and you have to wait for the cooldown to end before pressing start. Otherwise, you waste the buff at the start.

**Evidence:**

[In this video, you can see that sprinting after choosing the buff will make the buff icon show up at the bottom, meaning it was proc'd. Then, after pressing start, I sprinted a little bit and couldn't proc the buff again since it was on its 15 second cooldown.](https://youtu.be/nx-ocKy_50I)

[Conversely, in this video, you can see that walking up to the key, starting the domain, and then sprinting is more efficient in terms of proc'ing the card buff.](https://youtu.be/_vbTUm1xvKs)

**Significance:** With how the current abyss and upcoming 1.5 abyss are known to be massive DPS checks, it's crucial that you take full advantage of the abyss card buffs. +20% damage is generally worth more than a 4 noblesse effect buff, and it shouldn't be wasted if you want to 3\* a chamber. Moreover, this card can appear under the 'Effective this floor" category meaning it will help you throughout the entire floor.
