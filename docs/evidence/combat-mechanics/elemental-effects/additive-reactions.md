**Finding:**  
EM doesn’t snapshot for the new Additive Reactions (Spread and Aggravate).  
  
**Evidence:**

The Kazuha is C2. As seen in the video, Dendro MC Burst tick damage while standing in Kazuha’s Burst ring is 2467 (EM buff applied) and drops to 2103 once taken out of the field.  
Since DMC is Lv. 50, she doesn’t have her A4 unlocked.  
  
**Significance:**  
This helps us better understand the new Additive Reactions introduced with Dendro.  

## Spread

**Finding:**  
A Dendro attack can trigger both Quicken and Spread at the same time if the enemy already has a Quicken and Electro aura.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
Understanding Dendro reactions better.
