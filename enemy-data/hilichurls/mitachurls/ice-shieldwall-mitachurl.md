# Hilichurls

## Ice Shieldwall Mitachurl

Reason normally dictates that large creatures that see a lot of action should burn through a great number of calories to sustain themselves. As such, the present-day El Musk has proposed the "Mitachurl Index." This index correlates the percentage of mitachurls within the hilichurl population to the stability and success of hilichurl foraging activity.

## Attacks

* Uses a large cryo hand shield. The shield can be destroyed using pyro or blunt attacks, or dealing enough damage to it.
* Charges in a set direction until colliding with the player or a solid structure.
* Blocks attacks in the way of its' shields. Attacks from the side and back can still go through. If the shield is destroyed, it will be unable to perform this attack.
* If the player character strays too close, it can deliver a punch.
* If the player can't be reached by other attacks, digs in the ground for a cryo slime to throw at the player.
