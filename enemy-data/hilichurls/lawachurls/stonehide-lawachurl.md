* Punches its' chest and gives a battle cry before infusing itself with a geo armor. This attack will always be the first one attempted at the start of the fight, and can be done again after the armor is broken.

* Takes a wide right swing at the player.
* Takes a left swing followed up by a right punch into the ground.
  * Armor Upgrade: 6 chain explosion aftershocks will be triggered in a V shape from the ground punch.
* Goes into a crouch start position, and after a short delay quickly dashes in the direction of the player, inflicting large body slam damage.
  * Armor Upgrade: Starts the dash nearly instantaneous.
* Executes a high, long jump to the player's location, dealing massive damage on its' landing.
  * Armor Upgrade: Upon landing, sends out 6 chain explosion aftershocks in a + shape from its' landing spot.
* Leans forward, grabbing multiple geo slimes to throw at the player from ranged distance. This move will not spawn any slimes, they're simply projectiles.
