## Attacks

* Punches its' chest and gives a battle cry before infusing itself with an electro armor. This attack will always be the first one attempted at the start of the fight, and can be done again after the armor is broken. 
  * While protected by the armor, certain attacks will be upgraded.
* Takes a wide right swing at the player.
* Takes a left swing followed up by a right punch into the ground.
* Goes into a crouch start position, and after a short delay quickly dashes in the direction of the player, inflicting large body slam damage..
  * Armor Upgrade: Throws itself at the player instantly with its' hole body instead.
* Executes a high, long jump to the player's location, dealing massive damage on its' landing.
  * Armor Upgrade: Upon landing, sends out 4 chain lightnings in a + shape from the landing spot.
* Leans forward, grabbing multiple electro slimes to throw at the player from ranged distance. This move will not spawn any slimes, they're simply projectiles.
  * Armor Upgrade: Grabs a single large electro slime instead.
  * The slime thrown can be a normal or mutant slime. If a mutant slime is thrown, it will create additional explosions on impact.
* The following attack can only be used while protected by the armor: Smashes the ground with both fists, Summoning multiple lightning strikes in a small radius around itself. Sometimes this will be combod with a 2nd smash which will summon a larger lightning strike in a medium radius around itself and summon 3 electro shards.
  * The Electro shards left on the ground can be destroyed by elemental reactions and heavy attacks. If they're not destroyed after a while, they'll explode in a moderate AOE.
