## Cryo Regisvine

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/enemy/bosses/Enemy_Cryo_Regisvine_Icon.webp)

A monster formed from a vine that was imbued with the essence of biting frost within the Ley Lines.

Some studies hold that plants are like organs of the world, harmonizing the turbulent elemental energies of the Ley Lines. Concrete examples of this phenomena are Mist Flowers, Whopperflowers and the like, which brim over with elemental energy.

In certain circumstances, certain plants will turn into creatures of monstrous size and intent — such as the Cryo Regisvines — over the course of many years.

## Attacks

Upon either attacking it from range or after entering its arena, the Cryo Regisvine will unfurl from its resting position and stand outright.
In this first phase, either its' Eye or its' Base Gem are glowing and covered in a shield. Upon breaking it(with either elemental reactions or enough damage dealt), the fight will be moved to the first transition phase and afterward cycle back and forth with the ranged and melee phases.  

In this initial phase, it can attack you with the following attacks:
* Flings two ice beams into an overlapping cross pattern.
  * This is indicated by its' two lashes starting to glow brightly.
* Shoots homing icicles that will follow the player for a few seconds before losing their homing attribute.
  * This is indicated when the Regisvine raises its' lashers less high and without a glowing effect.
* The Regisvine slams itself into the ground three times.
  * Indicated by raising its' body upwards and a glow travelling up its' stem.
* Slashes itself into the ground and attacks with its' vines.

### Transitioning Phase

Upon breaking its' shield, the Cryo Regisvine will curl itself up and lay on the ground unmoving. During this time, the Regisvine will lose its' resistances and be unnable to move. This phase lasts about 10 to 15 seconds.  
* After recovering, it will raise itself up and continue to flail around its' body, dealing a huge amount of damage and knocking away any character in melee range.
  * This does not knock away summons such as Amber's baron bunny.
* After its' flail, the Regisvine will then return to its' normal combat patterns. Depending on what shield has last been broken, it will transition into the Outer or Inner Ring phases.

### Inner Ring Phase
* This phase is started if the last weak spot has been the gem on its base. Upon start, Cryo Regisvine will start to channel Cryo particles and blast it outwards, covering the outer ring of the arena in Cryo and dealing damage to the player should they not dodge. Standing on the Cryo on the outer side of the arena will quickly deplete the player's health.
* Flails its' body with deadly force.
  * This attack is triggered if a player is too close to the Regisvine.
* Leans its' head forward at the player, with its' buds (arms) spread, and locks onto the player location, then fires a beam of Cryo from its' corolla for a few seconds, dealing massive damage to any players caught in the beam. After firing the beam at the spot it locked onto, the Regisvine will proceed to slowly turn around 360 degrees.
* Channels for a moment before smashing its' body onto the last position of the player, three times. 
  * Afterwards, it will remain still for a moment.

### Outer Ring Phase
* This phase is started if the last weak spot has been the gem in its stem. Nothing of note will happen during this phase.
* Creates two ice beams that hone in on the player.
* Shoots homing icicles that will follow the player for a few seconds before losing their homing attribute.
* Slams itself into the ground at the player location.
* If the player negates breaking the corola for too long, it will start covering the ground in Cryo and summoning an ice rain aimed at the player, this attack is lethal.

## Pyro Regisvine

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/enemy/bosses/Enemy_Pyro_Regisvine_Icon.webp)

A giant vine that has absorbed the ancient flame that rages within the Ley Lines. It is restless, as if filled with an endless fury.

Poets, bards and even some academics believe that elements also contain emotions and hope. If this is true, then one can only wonder what emotions cause the Pyro Regisvine to burn eternally, writhing like one longing to be free of the confines of the earth...

## Attacks

Upon either attacking it from range or after entering its arena, the Pyro Regisvine will unfurl from its resting position and stand outright.
In this first phase, either its' Eye or its' Base Gem are glowing and covered in a shield. Upon breaking it(with either elemental reactions or enough damage dealt), the fight will be moved to the first transition phase and afterward cycle back and forth with the ranged and melee phases.  

In this initial phase, it can attack you with the following attacks:
* Slams its' face into the ground at the player location, sending pyro tremors through the ground in the direction it faces.
* Uses its' buds to send small fireballs at the player in rapid succession.
* Slams its' head on the ground and sweeps it 180 degrees.
* After a short charge-up, hurls a fireball at the player.

### Transitioning Phase

Upon breaking its' shield, the Pyro Regisvine will curl itself up and lay on the ground unmoving. During this time, the Regisvine will lose its' resistances and be unnable to move. This phase lasts about 10 to 15 seconds.  
* After recovering, it will raise itself up and continue to flail around its' body, dealing a huge amount of damage and knocking away any character in melee range.
  * This does not knock away summons such as Amber's baron bunny.
* After its' flail, the Regisvine will then return to its' normal combat patterns. Depending on what shield has last been broken, it will transition into the Outer or Inner Ring phases.

### Inner Ring Phase & Outer Ring Phase  
Share the same attacks:
* Points its' corolla upwads, along with its' buds, causing Pyro energy to erupt from the ground in multiple locations, including the player's feet.
  * This attack can only be used once in this phase.
* Channels for a moment before smashing its' body onto the last position of the player, three times. 
  * Afterwards, it will remain still for a moment.
* Slams its' head on the ground and sweeps it 180 degrees.
  * It will repeat this again in a 180 degree radius, and sometimes a 300 degree radius instead.
* Flattens and stretches out its' petals, then spins, dealing a large amount of damage and infusing the ground with Pyro.
  * A circle of Pyro will appear around it, indicating the radius of the attack. 
* Slams its' face into the ground at the player location, sending pyro tremors through the ground in the direction it faces.
* Uses its' buds to send small fireballs at the player in rapid succession.
* Slams its' head on the ground and sweeps it 180 degrees.
  * After a short charge-up, hurls a fireball at the player.
