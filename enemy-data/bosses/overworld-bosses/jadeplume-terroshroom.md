# Jadeplume Terrorshroom

Its intelligence has already reached and perhaps has even surpassed real animals, and it will actively hunt prey to obtain sustenance. Its tail has a lovely jade plumage that seems very similar to that of the ancient sacred beast that the Spantamad school reveres. As far as the logic of mimesis is concerned, it seems quite likely that the two beings once walked the earth together.

## Attacks

### Normal
* Performs a 3-part combo consisting of a sweeping bite, a head slam, and a jumping slam, dealing 80% ATK, 80% ATK, 100% ATK as AoE Dendro DMG. The Jadeplume Terrorshroom will also imbue itself with a Dendro aura during the jumping slam. This combo may also be cut short.
* Briefly imbues itself with a Dendro aura, swings its tail and launches a barrage of projectiles at the player. Each projectile deals 30% ATK as Dendro DMG on hit. This attack can be chained up to 3 times.
* Imbues itself with a Dendro aura, sends several spores upwards which then land and explode, dealing 50% ATK as AoE Dendro DMG over a large area.

### Activated 

* The Jadeplume Terrorshroom's Fury bar will fill by 2% when hit by an Electro attack, fill by 15% when a Quicken, Aggravate, or Spread reaction is triggered on it, and reduce by 34% when hit by a Pyro attack.
When the Fury bar is fully filled, the Jadeplume Terrorshroom will become activated and perform Spore Rain, Furious Charge, or Rapid Pecks, then become paralyzed for ~15 seconds with reduced Resistances.

* Imbues itself with a Dendro aura, scatters countless spores into the air that home towards the player, each dealing 45% ATK as Dendro DMG on hit.

* Charges at the player twice, dealing 120% ATK as Dendro DMG on hit.

* Aimlessly swings its beak 4 times, dealing 120% ATK as Dendro DMG with each swing.

### Scorched

* If the Burning reaction is inflicted upon the Jadeplume Terrorshroom while it is not in the activated state, it will become Scorched. It will then summon 3 Floating Dendro Fungi to assist in battle and return to the normal state. The Floating Dendro Fungi will already be in their Scorched state when summoned.
