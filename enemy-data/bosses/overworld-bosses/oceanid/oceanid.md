description: A life-form created from condensed Hydro elements of incredible purity. Often attached to bodies of water.It is said that as water bodies become purer, the Hydro elements within grow more abundant, causing the Oceanids to grow more powerful. It is also said by some that Oceanids were once sea creatures from a home far away who carried the fragments of a long-dead god to the many corners of this world. Perhaps they did this so that the love their god held for this world could be spread through the waters to all the land...

## Attacks

* The boss cannot be attacked or receive damage outside of event versions.
* Summons various different water animals, named Hydro Mimics, that must be fought and defeated in order to harm the boss.
  * There are 8 different types of mimics in total that can be spawned by Oceanid. 
  * Each type has a decreased resistance to certain element, apart from Hydro, which they are completely immune to. 
  * As with all other Hydro wildlife, they can hover on water.
  * The animals are split into 3 different categories based on the number that is summoned of them at once; Trio Mimics(Cranes&Raptors), Duo Mimic(Mallard&Crab, Boar&Ferrett) and Solo Mimics(Frog&Finch)
* After clearing two waves of Hydro Mimics, the Oceanid will select two random tiles in the 3×3 grid of the arena and sink them. 
  * The central arena tile will never be selected and is therefore a safe spot for players to stand on during this ability.
  * The sinking tiles may deal damage to the player if sinking along.
* The Oceanid submerges for a period of time, before resurfacing again.
* If the Hydro Mimics are not defeated in a certain amount of time, the Oceanid creates a whirlpool below the player that follows them, deals DoT damage, and explodes after a while, dealing massive damage.
* Talks continuously, taunting the player with its' non-stop chatting and stalling the fight.
  * Muting audio is ineffective against this attack.
