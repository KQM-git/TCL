# Weekly Bosses

## Azhdaha

In an age that has all but faded from memory, he stood shoulder to shoulder with one who ruled over a harbor of stone. But in the end, the two came into conflict, and the dragon was banished to a dark place deep underground. Over the long years of his imprisonment, his power has slowly dissipated. He has also become disfigured from the various kinds of erosion he has been subjected to. The faint rattling of this dragon lord's shackles and his deep, angry growl echo through the bowels of the mountains like memories of a bygone era.

## Weakspot Details

* Azhdaha's **Moonlit Tree** phase (submerging underground while leaving his tail on the surface) has two independent hitboxes that can be exploited with a large AoE attack (essentially double the DMG dealt)

## Energy drops

None.

## Resistance Table

Gains +60% Resistnace to the first element he infuses with. This is kept after infusing with a second element.  
Gains +50% Resistance to the second element he infuses with.

## Attacks

Azhdaha has 3 phases, an initial geo one, and 2 where he infuses with a random element that is chosen at the start of every week and displayed on his domain door.  
His attacks will gain special effects depending on the infused element.
### Phase 1:

  * Pyro: Damage type converted to Pyro, fires several fireballs into the air that will hit the ground randomly and leave a burning mark, which continuously damages players in its AoE. (Phase 2)
  * Hydro: Damage type converted to Hydro, leaves a moderately-sized Hydro mark on the ground which explodes shortly after. (Phase 2)
* Slams his body sideways, dealing damage in a large AoE that extends towards the attack's direction. 
  * This attack cannot be avoided using dash iframes.

  * Each one pushes the player away.
  * Hydro: Damage type converted to Hydro, launches projectiles in multiple direction from Azhdaha's location. (Phase 2)
  * Pyro: Damage type converted to Pyro, fires several fireballs into the air that will hit the ground randomly and leave a burning circle, which continuously damages players in its AoE. (Phase 2)
* Jumps, then greatly impacts the earth and leaves cracked earth that will explode twice around him in a large AoE. The second explosion has a larger AoE than the first. This ability will produce several effect based on the current infused element.
  * Hydro: Damage type converted to Hydro, and launches water streams in multiple directions from Azhdaha's location.

* Slams his tail once if target is behind him.
  * Electro: Damage type converted to Cryo. Slower than normal Tail Slam, but cause two Electro explosions around the impact area. (Phase 3)
  * Cryo: Damage type converted to Cryo. Slower than normal Tail Slam, but will summon several Ice Spikes around the impact area that will explode twice. (Phase 3)

  * Electro: Damage type converted to Electro. (Phase 3)
  * Cryo: Damage type converted to Cryo. (Phase 3)
* Submerges underground and digs around the arena. This action will trigger a massive earthquake and many rocks will rains to the arena for a while. 
  * Azhdaha deals damage every time he resurfaces.
* Spawns a barrage of Elemental-infused stones to the target. The stones will explode shortly upon impact. This ability will produce additional effects based on the current infused element. (Phase 3)
  * Electro: Explodes on impact while releasing small thunderstrokes that expand outwards from the initial AoE, dealing Electro DMG. (Phase 3)
  * Cryo: Explodes on impact and leaves raining ice shards upon impact, dealing Cryo DoT to characters in the affected area for a period of time. (Phase 3)

### Phase 2: Single Elemental Infusion  
Upon reaching ~67% HP, Azhdaha infuses an element (Hydro or Pyro), gaining an additional 60% Elemental Resistance to this infused Element, resulting in a total of 70% Elemental Resistance to this element.

Azhdaha can still use any ability from Phase 1. These Phase 1 abilities will be infused with the current infused Element.

* Slams his legs unto earth, unleashing continuous shockwaves around himself 5 times and ending with one final huge shockwave. 
  * This ability will produce several effects, based off the current infused element, and can potentially stun-lock the player.
  * Azhdaha only uses Tremors during a phase transition (when he gains an elemental infusion) and in the final Phase 3.
  * This attack cannot be avoided using dash iframes.
  * Hydro: Damage type will be converted into Hydro. AoE is increased. Six lines of water streams splinting evenly on each sides will follow instantly after the final huge shockwave.
  * Pyro: Damage type will be converted into Pyro. AoE is increased. Leaves several fireballs in the air, that will hit the ground randomly upon impact shortly after the final huge shockwave and leave burning circles on the ground, damaging players who step on it.
* Roars and initiates a large AoE attack of the infused element.
  * Hydro: Summons several moving large Hydro orbs, that will slowly rotate around the arena and deal damage per second upon impact.
  * Pyro: Summons several meteors that fall from the sky. The meteors leave a large pool of lava upon impact, that lasts for a period of time and deals continuous Pyro DoT to characters in the affected area.

### Phase 3: Dual Elemental Infusion
Upon reaching ~33% HP, Azhdaha will infuse himself with another Element (Electro or Cryo), therefore gaining a dual Elemental Infusion. Azhdaha will gain an additional 50% Elemental Resistance to this second infused Element, resulting in a total of 60% Elemental Resistance to this second element.

Azhdaha can still use any ability from Phases 1 and 2. These Phase 1 or 2 abilities will be infused with the corresponding elements.

* Depending on infused element:
  * Forms several Thunder Spheres and launches them towards the target, dealing Electro Damage.
  * Forms a Cryo Sphere in the air, that will then periodically summon several crystal lance 5 times, homing towards the target.

* Submerges underground while leaving his tail on the surface. 
  * Azhdaha cannot be killed in this state, but can still be damaged. 
  * If Azhdaha's HP reaches 0 in during this attack, one extra hit will be required to kill him once he reappears above ground.
  * Electro: The tail will periodically zap parts of the arena in a cone AoE, that changes after every occurrence of this attack. Targeted areas are indicated with a purple AoE.
  * Cryo: The tail will unleash a massive hailstorm around it. The fallen ice chunks will explode upon impact, followed by circular Ice Spikes that will pulse thrice in the affected area.
