# Weekly Bosses

## La Signora - First form

Unlike other Fatui who use the authority granted by Delusions, her Delusion is meant to shackle a flame that will devour everything. As opposed to a weapon used to kill, it might be more fitting to consider this a tool of imprisonment.
And it was the embers of that flame, which had accumulated over many long years, that would break through the frosty seal of the Delusion and apply a warped rogue upon her.

None.

## Attacks

At first, Signora will utilize Cryo-based attacks via her Delusion. 
  * During this phase, Sheer Cold will accumulate, once the gauge is full, the player will lose ~1% HP per second. 
  * Halfway through the battle, the rate of Sheer Cold accelerates. 
  * Hearts of Flame are placed around the edges of the arena to counter its effects.

All of her attacks will cause Frosted Floor: the floor will become patched with ice, dealing Cryo DMG per interval. 
  * Moreover, her attacks will also amplify the accumulation of Sheer Cold should the player gets hit by them.

* Rains down ice in a small area, to deal Cryo DMG.
* Summons a group of ice shards in a straight line, dealing Cryo DMG.
* Imbues three ice flowers which will explode after a short period of time.
* Hurls in a wheel of ice shards that travels in a circular arc, dealing rapid Cryo DMG. This is usually done as a follow up to her Ice Shards attack.
* Signora teleports to the player character's position, releasing a small AoE burst of Cryo upon impact. 
  * She may also perform this attack if the player lingers too close to her.
* Signora launches five icy spears that home in on the player character one after another.
* Signora conjures six icy spears that surround the player character before converging on them, dealing Cryo damage.
* Signora marks the player character with a spearhead ice before striking it towards the player. The frigid ice will then explode in a few seconds, dealing massive DMG.  

La Signora will relocate at the center of the arena in order to encase herself inside a large icicle when her HP drops critically low. 
  * During this phase, Sheer Cold will accumulate much rapidly and she will attack the player with homing icicles, lock-on target ice shards, and ice flowers. 
  * This phase is similar to the Cryo Hypostasis's Glacial Shield.
  * Crimson Lotus Moths will spawn which can be picked up. This will imbue your attacks will Pyro, dealing bonus DMG against her cocoon.
  * Using Elemental Reactions, especially Melt, will also help destroy her cocoon.
