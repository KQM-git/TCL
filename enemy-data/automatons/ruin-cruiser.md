# Automaton

## Ruin Cruiser

Legend has it that they were war machines left behind by a nation that had been destroyed. Compared to the more common Ruin Guards, their forms have greater value in the study of biomimesis. The distributed design and battle mode seem to have come from honeybee colonies, able to change forms and to attack from different directions.

## Weakspot Details

Core inside the head. For unknown reasons this core counts as a weakspot but will not trigger certain effects related to it (ex. prototype crescent).

## Attacks

* Summons three orbitals that will charge an orb, which is then shot from the main head. The core is exposed during this attack.

* Using the three orbitals as a scope, the main head fires a long and slender stinger. While charging the core is protected.

* By withdrawing its three orbitals and diverting all power to the head, it pushes itself back while also laying an energized orb. This attack is performed when the player is close to the Ruin Cruiser. The orb stays on the field for some time and does Physical Damage for the duration it's on the field. After some time the orb will explode in a small AoE. If the Ruin Cruiser is defeated before the timer is up for the orb, then the orb will explode prematurely. It will expose its' core during the charging of the orb.

* The Ruin Cruiser fires multiple stingers into the air before they all bombard the area in front of it. The attack will cover a large area and is always fired 4 times. While charging, its' core is exposed. When firing its' core is protected.

* When the weak spot of the main head is hit twice while it is exposed, the Ruin Cruiser deactivates for a short time where it does not attack.
