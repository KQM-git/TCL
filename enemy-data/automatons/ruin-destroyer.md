# Automaton

## Ruin Destroyer

Legend has it that they were war machines left behind by a nation that had been destroyed. Compared to the more common Ruin Guards, their design has greater value in the study of biomimesis. The giant crown, composed of several parts, looks like a scary plant. It's not known what one has to go through in order to design such scary machine.

## Weakspot Details

Core inside the head. For unknown reasons this core counts as a weakspot but will not trigger certain effects related to it (ex. prototype crescent).

## Attacks

* Opening its' head, the Destroyer spins its' whole head on the ground and flails it across. Its' core is protected during this attack.

* By firing a charged beam of pure energy at the ground, the Destroyer creates an energy field centered on its' target. The field has a large AoE that deals Damage for the duration of this attack. Its' core is exposed during this attack.

* Borrowing into the ground and planting its roots, the core gathers energy and creates a Vacuum Field that sucks the player in. After charging, it will overload its' core, exploding anything in a medium AoE around itself. Its' core is exposed during this attack.

* Using its' core, it fires small energy orbs two to five times. Its' core is protected during this attack.

* Digs into the ground before it reemerges close to its' target. Similar to the Geovishap Hatchling, it cannot be damaged while it's burrowing.

* After hitting its' weak spot twice, it becomes deactivated. During this short time it will not attack.
