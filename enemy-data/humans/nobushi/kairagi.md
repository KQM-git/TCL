## Kairagis

## Kairagi: Fiery Might

They practiced martial arts since they were young, but lost the opportunity to serve the people due to certain reasons and turned from the righteous path. Their blade's edges are not cold like ordinary steel, but instead burn with a bitter flame. They seem to have used paper seals, created from a lost Kamuna art, to set the blades afire.

## Attacks

* Slashes at the player three times. 
  * When the blade is infused with Pyro, there is a possibility that the final strike may be substituted for a Spin Attack instead.
* Jumps backwards, away from the player.
* Infuses its blade with Pyro and performs a ground slam. 
  * This Pyro infusion will last for 30 seconds and will cause all other attacks to be imbued with Pyro as well. 
  * This weapon infusion cannot be neutralised by any Elemental Reactions.
* Clenches and raise their fist to taunt their opponents, said taunt is identical to that of the Maguu Kenki. 
  * They will not perform this move if they are in an Avenger state.
* When an ally Kairagi dies in battle, the other Kairagi will attempt to avenge their fallen comrade. The Kairagi imbues itself with a fiery-orange aura, as well as infusing its' blade with Pyro.
  * While in this state, the Kairagi is also immune to all stun skills, including Frozen elemental reactions and Zhongli's Planet Befall Petrified. 
  * The Kairagi will then gain a 30-second 50% max HP increase (this will also heal the Kairagi if it is under its max HP) and will then enter the Avenger state permanently. 
  * While in this state the Kairagi has increased interruption resistance and will always prioritize infusing their blade if the blade's infusion ends.  
* Points its' blade towards the player and charge towards them once.
* Performs a spin attack.
* Jumps towards the player location and performs a downwards strike. 
    * In the Avenger state, It is possible for the Kairagi to perform a double slash after this attack.
* Enters a stance with its' blade held downwards, pointed diagonally, during which it will block player attacks from the direction they're facing.
* Clenches its fist towards the player.

## Kairagi: Dancing Thunder

They possess highly advanced martial art skills but found no use for them for various reasons. Out of desperation, they have fallen onto the path of evil. They use paper seals, created from a Kamuna art that has been lost for centuries, to infuse their blades with the power of lightning.
