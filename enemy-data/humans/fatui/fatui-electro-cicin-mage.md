# Fatui

## Fatui Electro Cicin Mage

Their origins and what they look like under that mask are both mysteries. Similarly to the way that Electro Cicins go crazy for Mist Grass, Cicin Mages take great pleasure in toying with their prey.

## Attacks

* Summons three Electro Cicins. 
  * Summoned Cicins will despawn when the Electro Cicin Mage is defeated. 
  * The Mage will only use this ability when no Cicins are summoned.
* Teleports summoned Cicins into a line in front of the Mage and commands them to charge consecutively at the target in the form of electricity balls. After charging, Cicins become immobilized briefly.
* Teleports to a nearby point as an electric current. 
  * The Mage can use this ability immediately after recovering poise, allowing her to blink out of a stagger or knockback animation.
* Consecutively teleports up to three times towards the target. 
  * The Mage will only use this ability if far from the target. This is considered a different ability than the regular teleport, so the Mage can use them in succession.
* Summons a falling bolt of Electro energy to strike its' foe; leaves behind a static charge that deals Electro DoT to targets within.
  * Certain versions are able to consecutively summon 3, 4, or 6 thunderbolts instead of just 1.
* After ~40 seconds, absorbs all summoned Cicins, conjures an Electro Shield and then begins flying towards the player.
  * The Shield grants immunity to DMG and increased movement speed (faster than a player's base running speed, but slower than base sprinting speed) and prevents the Mage from being staggered or knocked down.
  * The Shield continuously deals AoE Electro DMG to surrounding targets.
  * The Shield depletes gradually over ~12 seconds, but can be depleted faster with elemental reactions.
  * Afterwards, the ability needs to recharge over another 40 seconds. The charge rate of this ability is affected by energy charge rate modifiers.
