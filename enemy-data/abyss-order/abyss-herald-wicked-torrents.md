## Attacks  
* Performs a series of slash attacks, within the Hydro shield form the slashing pattern will change.  

* Raises both arms before unleashing a cross-shaped water projectile towards the player. If hit by this projectile, the elemental skill & burst of the active character will have their on-going cooldown increased by 6 seconds.

* Conjures one or two concentrated water projectiles with its' blades and fires them forward.

* After falling to 20% health, the Abyss Herald will remove its' remaining health to imbue itself with a powerful Hydro shield. Breaking this shield will kill the Herald. Once the shield is activated, nearby players are knocked back from the Herald and damaged. The Herald also gains new/upgraded attacks when it is equipped with the Hydro shield.

* Turns into a spinning wheel and charges at the player. The number of charges the Abyss Herald will perform depends on how much health it has left. If the Herald is above 50% health, it only lunges once at the player. If the Herald is below 50% health, it lunges twice. In Hydro shield form, it will lunge three times. If the Hydro shield is below half strength, it will lunge four times.

* Slashes the air numerous times with its' blade before unleashing 8 Hydro projectiles in a circular pattern. This attack is only used when the Herald is in its' Hydro shield form. If hit by any of those projectiles, the elemental skill & burst of the active character will have their on-going cooldown increased by 6 seconds.
