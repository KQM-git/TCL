# Eye of the Storm

## Eye of the Storm

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/enemy_eye_of_the_storm.webp)

The formation of an Eye of the Storm indicates that the elemental ley lines of a region are blocked, which has led to siltation. Its reckless, heedless wielding of storms that all but sweeps people off their feet may be due to its nature as a symbol of the world stricken by malaise.

## Attacks

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Vacuum Crash" %}
Creates a vacuum wind area of effect that draws the player to the middle of the circle, and then crashes down hard at the center. After using this ability, it will expose its core for a while.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Tornado" %}
While in mid-air, the Eye of the Storm charges for a while, and then quickly forms a tornado that charges in a straight line.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Domain of the Wild Wind" %}
Flies high, and starts to channel Anemo power to the earth, creating a wind wall around it that prevents the player from moving away. After a while, it will summon multiple pillars of wind that would chase the player and scatter rocks everywhere, dealing continuous AoE DMG. 

* While channeling this ability, it will expose its core, a single hit while exposed will make it fall to the ground.
