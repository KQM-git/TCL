**Findings and Evidence:**  
1. The Omni-Ubiquity Net (OUN) has a 1-animal-per-net limit. - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/0ZnybwvyPDA)
2. If more than one animal is in the OUN's aoe, the animal closest to the player is captured. - ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/0vAt78Ie5U4), [imgur](https://imgur.com/a/7QrDRHe), [imgur](https://imgur.com/a/ilbkbsQ), [imgur](https://imgur.com/a/egQVxXd), [imgur](https://imgur.com/a/ZiGwoka))
3. Using the OUN near an animal will startle nearby animals, even if Sayu/Aloy are in the party, even if no animal is actually captured. - ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/OUBx9G5cVxo), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Kv1Utj4YV50), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/NML6hmKToNE))
4. The OUN does not seem to have a time limit on how long it can be held without capturing an animal (Additionally, you can rotate a full 360 degrees while holding it, but there is a maximum upper/lower angle that it can be aimed). - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/9HORkvTCyUA)
5. The OUN can't be used in Domains or Abyss, like most other gadgets. - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/-D7_MHUTE_4)
6. The OUN can capture birds in midair if the player is quick enough. - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Sey9eQSjA9A)
7. It's possible to capture frozen boars from Dragonspine without unfreezing them. - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/NMe2RD18M-M)
8. The OUN can be used in another player's world, regardless of guest/host status. - ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/tYlTs1cVdyo), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/xqD3ECkVCHo))
9. OUN has an estimated range of at least 23.46 meters.
    * Albedo E radius is nearly exactly 4 Abyss Tiles, which is 2.55 x 4 = 10.20 meters - [imgur](https://imgur.com/a/dybme5X).
    * Albedo E radius on Mondstadt street is ~10 blocks. OUN flew ~23 Mondstadt stone blocks or 23.46 meters - [imgur](https://imgur.com/a/SvuScot).
10. How the player's distance from an animal and aim with the OUN affect which animal is captured has inconclusive results and needs further investigation. - ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/rZAj79ay5os), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ovFJ0C6YzNI), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/vWpTt1-Cf_0))

**Significance:**  
* Better understanding of how the Omni-Ubiquity Net (OUN) works.
* Better chance of catching the animal you want.
* No cheating to get achievements.
