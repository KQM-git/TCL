**Finding:**  
Hitlag has no effect on food buff durations.

**Evidence:**  
[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G-N9AFx5Ctl8MXqfmlecY1sI4ZxUBQJSLftApVEZlUY/edit?usp=sharing)
(2 defence food, 2 atk food, 2 potions, 1 recovery, and 1 stamina)

**Significance:**  
Food buffs are fundamentally different from the buffs that do extend. May be useful for future food buffs.
