**Theory:**  
Genshin's overworld works under a different set of reaction rules than the players, additionally supported by the entry [Overworld Entities Have Levels](../../evidence/fluff/overworld.md#overworld-entities-have-levels), one of those different rules of reactions is Electrified water, when applying electro to water, it does not produce electro-charged, instead it infuses the water with electro for a few seconds, which does not apply electro, does not spread, and is not affected by 4TF set bonus, this electrified water can damage both the player and enemies. Water additionally is seen as friend to both player and enemy, which questions the nature of this Electrified reaction even further.

**Evidence:**  
Electrified water evidence, including 4TF attempts, enemy taking damage, as well as water never being a trigger to any reaction, only aura, as it's friendly to both parties: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuS2G0SUkHc)

**Significance:**  
There might be more reactions unknown to the player coded into the game's files for various reason, potentially to be used in the future or simply scrapped ideas that have not been remove

### Electrified Water Properties

**Finding:**  
The duration of the environmental elemental reaction Electrified Water has varying duration based on the gauge strength of electro applied. There are approximately 2 seconds between each tick. IA of electro lasts for 3 ticks, 2B lasts for 5 ticks, and 4C lasts for 10 ticks.  
The damage dealt by Electrified water is affected by Electro Resistance. For example, a character with 15% Electro Resistance will take 85% of the Electrified Water damage.  

**Evidence:**  
Video contains Fischl and Lisa getting 3 ticks after applying 1A electro with charge attacks. Razor hold E and Beidou E get 5 ticks, and Beidou Q initial proc gets 10 ticks. The video also shows damage being reduced according to electro resistance obtained by the Protective Canopy Elemental Resonance. Finally, there is also footage of the monolith taking 248 damage from Electrified Water. The nearby slime (10% electro res) takes 223 damage from the same tick. Each tick reduces the monolith's health by about 1%. The monolith on Floor 2 of the Spiral Abyss will take damage from Electrified Water. Using Electrified Water, the monolith is found to have 0% electro resistance and approximately 24,800 HP: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aevZ6FPmcl4)  

**Significance:**  
Learning more about how environmental reactions are programmed/calculated. Also, don't bring electro units if you're trying to get the achievement for Floor 2-2 of the Spiral Abyss.  

### Electro Crystal Range

**Finding:** Electro crystals' pulse range works in a rectangle range, with the crystal being not centered, but rather between the center and the side

**Evidence:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8QfbYvuR6Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8QfbYvuR6Q)

**Significance:** electro crystals work in a similar way to cryo&pyro stamen flowers, for a better understanding of the overworld

### Invisible Water Layer

**Theory:**  
Genshin's water is coded in a way where the visual water and actual layer are separate, thus there is an invisible field of water that does not apply wet in random places of the world, but can be infused

**Evidence:**  
1. Invisible water being infused by Anemo MC: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR1zJjhqASI)  
   Invisible water being infused by Sucrose: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAXeOFUDlic) credits to @ishnu  
2. Invisible water infused by electro: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tpGWZ4hnfo)
3. Water hitbox & reactions from UNDER the water, UNDER the ocean: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWmhqgGfLaM)

**Significance:**  
Understanding the cursed overworld of Teyvat

### Overworld Entities Have Levels

**Finding:**  
Overworld has levels for every "body", including water and grass and sand, trees, rocks, and other things that we can't prove in any other way other than the game's code which shows this, thus varying stats which is proven by their damage.

**Evidence:**  
Flower stamens (cryo & pyro have the same scaling but different element): [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gCbmYT5gPk)  
Water (using electrified): [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSepgh_2M_M)  
Grass (using burning): [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Xffbwx7b0)  

**Signifiance:**  
Almost cracking the code for overworld

### Genshin has 2D Water

**Finding:**  
Genshin's water exists only in horizontal, 2 dimensional sheets. Additionally, true water is not graphically represented at all times, while graphically represented water is only an approximation.

**Evidence:**  
[Album](https://imgur.com/a/j0b5Y5a)  
1 shows Jean standing in waterfall without getting wet.  
2 shows venti climbing into waterfall below the 2d plane of "true water" without getting wet, but getting wet when he climbs into it at a slightly higher angle. When Venti then falls through the waterfall, he remains dry the entire time before impacting the second 2D plane of water.  
Greyhound's videos demonstrate that such planes appear to have water properties from below (Clip 3), and that its edges in some cases look to be perfectly square (Clip  4). Razor illustrates the trouble with this in Clip 5 by electrocharging the "true water" hidden below a dry floor and hurting himself with the resulting electrocharge AoE.

**Significance:**  
Electro is awful for the overworld because you can electrocharge water which resides in a flat sheet invisibly below the ground with AoE attacks. By doing this, you take continuous damage while standing on a dry surface. Also, you can stand in waterfalls without getting wet.

### Environment Reactions Base

**Theory:**  
Environment uses a different set of reaction bases than players, thanks to the EM buffs and my prior testing of electro crystal levels, we can conclude that although the value at release was the same as for the player, now it's different, with the player having a new one, and the electro crystals using the old, unchanged base.

**Evidence:**  
The video shows a level 84 electro-charged tick of the pre 1.6 base (1243)

**Significance:**  
We're getting ever so closer to figuring out the cursed world of teyvat's code

## 4-piece set bonuses on environment reactions

**Bug:** Sometimes set bonuses do not work properly if triggered on unconventional sources

**Evidence:** [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPByPR2TubV4zjXSKhIhhWEww2Oo7Tmwh](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPByPR2TubV4zjXSKhIhhWEww2Oo7Tmwh)

**Significance:** This explains some strange damage numbers when fighting enemies in the overworld

## Location remembered between map tabs

**Theory:** Genshin remembers your location and world state(such as bosses) in different map tabs separately.  

**Evidence:** Anemo hypostasis and other world bosses normally respawn after 3 minutes and teleporting away&back (as shown at the end), but doesn't respawn after going to the Archipelago, additionally teapot shows that it remembers your ogriginal location in Teyvat upon leaving: [Video](https://youtu.be/oeCJF5fXqqMkqm)  

**Significance:** It'll be relevant whenever more overworld mechanics are added which refresh when tping in/out or if we get more map tabs.
