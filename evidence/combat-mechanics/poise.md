## A Deep Dive into Genshin's Stagger Mechanics

Translated from: [https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=24216449&rand=913](https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=24216449&rand=913) by [Genshin Impact Wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Poise)

The [Genshin Impact Fandom Wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Interruption_Resistance#Practice_Data) has tables of poise data tested in game.

## Theoretical Data

The [Genshin Impact Fandom Wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Interruption_Resistance/Theoretical_Data) has tables on extrapolated values based off of the current running theory on poise. Actual gameplay may differ from the values there, as the theory is still evolving.



## Character Base Poise is Based on Weapon Type

**Finding:**  
Character base poise or stagger res is base on the character's weapon type (melee and range)

**Evidence:**  
For range units using Fischl and Yanfei vs a basic hilli mob

* [Fischl Poise](https://youtu.be/cM_BoweqidU)
* [Yanfei Poise](https://youtu.be/us6Am196hoE)

For melee units: using Beidou, XQ and XL vs a basic hilli mob

* [Beidou Poise 1](https://youtu.be/11nEMUdwmhI)
* [Beidou Poise 2](https://youtu.be/NzQetJnmgoc)
* [Xingqiu Poise 1](https://youtu.be/RvF74VWLab8)
* [Xingqiu Poise 2](https://youtu.be/yPV3C4xuomk)
* [Xiangling Poise 1](https://youtu.be/q5Fib_VG-Xc)
* [Xiangling Poise 2](https://youtu.be/QXML2v3dvDs)

[Childe Poise Ranged + Melee Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhA-uOrUdFU)

**Significance:**  

* Claymore, sword, and Polearm units have the same base poise. 
* Catalyst and bow units have the same base poise.
* Melee units has higher base poise compared to range units.


## Fall Damage Is Influenced By Poise

**Finding:**  
The velocity from fall dmg can be influenced by interrupt resist or poise, and can increase fall dmg to 160%. 

**Evidence:**  
Original clip is from xf3, then made to edit to make it side by side. In the video below it shows an abyss mage with 0 poise (stunned/staggered) vs an abyss mage with 2.25 poise. mage at 0 poise was launched at higher velocity than the mage who is dancing. This is easily reproducible.

**Significance:**  
Before launching an opponent with Jean E, reduce its poise to 0 and stagger them first, then watch your fall dmg hit higher numbers.

## Poise stack

**Finding:**  
Different sources of interrupt resistance can stack.

**Evidence:**  
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF7szUj3AWo)  
No interrupt resistance: Staggered on hit 1  
Guide to Afterlife: Staggered on hit 3  
Raincutter: Staggered on hit 4  
Guide to Afterlife + Raincutter: Staggered on hit 8  

**Significance:**  
Stacking interrupt resistance allows characters to further avoid being staggered.
