**Finding:**  
The Abyss Blessing from Nov 16 2021 to Nov 30 2021, Splendiferous Blessing, is an attack from your character that deals true damage based on enemy level and unaffected by ATK, DMG%, crit, char LVL, and resistance. This damage does not deal poise damage.  

**Evidence:**  
* [Raiden Skill works, Superconduct does not affect damage](https://youtu.be/8KTd9xqxyxE)
* [Albedo Skill works](https://youtu.be/2Dd_XYG8gr8)
* [Qiqi healing works](https://youtu.be/fZuulyOt6Y8)
* [Mona Omen doesn't affect damage, damage doesn't pop Omen bubble](https://youtu.be/FQsm79euz7o) 
* [WGS is triggered](https://youtu.be/1fgCluabN98)
* [Unforged stacks](https://youtu.be/Ea5XnJIOr2A)
* [Bell DMG\% doesn't work](https://youtu.be/tfagn8C2tpY) - Reens\#9389
* Damage scaling: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QfeXlmnqfXLJUzoC9zP79Th3JVY5BLz8jPAHzZZKzXc/edit?usp=sharing)

**Significance:**  
Assuming other Abyss Blessing procs operate similarly, they will benefit weaker accounts more so than stronger accounts since they add damage unaffected by investment level. Players do not need to play around buffing their Abyss Blessing damage.
