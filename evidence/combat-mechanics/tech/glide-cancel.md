## Wavedashing

**Theory/Finding:**  
While in a wind current (such as Venti hold skill), you can jump, glide, and land instantly.  
This is done by jumping, then pressing jump again exactly 4 frames later at 60 fps, or 2 frames later at 30 fps (not sure but I tried counting how many frames the jump took).  
Has worked with every character I've tried so far, but there may be examples where this doesn't work.
Can be known as glide cancel, wave dash, or wavedash.

**Evidence:**  
I found this technique through this video: [Bilibili Video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Cb4y1d7Kr?from=search&seid=9267604745435991278)

In the few english comments I could find about this, people often said you had to do it by canceling CA, or canceling the glide with N1, or it's just a keqing tech.  
In reality, I think this can be done at any point with anyone as long as you can jump (while on flat ground).

Somewhat doable at 30fps, insanely difficult at 60fps (though not humanly impossible!).

**Significance:**  
Could be used in teams with Venti to do extremely fast cancels without using stamina. Possibly consistent at 30 fps, but usability at 60fps is very questionable.

## Geo construct Wavedashing

**Theory/Finding:**  
With certain attacks, notably ones that move the character forwards or backwards, it's possible to instant glide cancel/wavedash off of edges, such as buildings and geo constructs (Geo MC, Albedo, and Zhongli skill). 

There are two ways to do this, the method used depends on the attack and the construct used.  
1. After attack, hold the direction toward the construct, and press jump twice very quickly (like a normal wavedash).  
- Examples: Xiangling CA with Zhongli pillar, Keqing CA with Albedo flower  
2. After attack, press jump with no movement, then hold the direction toward the construct and press jump again while holding direction.  
- Examples: Xiangling CA with Albedo flower, Keqing N1 on building edge.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
Requires precise positioning, only a limited number of attacks gain any frame advantage, and requires climbing and standing on a geo construct, which greatly limits what enemies this can even work on. Nonetheless, it's a Venti-less way to wavedash (though a bit slower), and could potentially find niche uses for certain content.
