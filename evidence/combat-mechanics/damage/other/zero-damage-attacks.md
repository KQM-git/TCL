**Finding:**  
Properties of 0 damage attacks:
* They can apply elements and react. This comes with the associated ICD.
* They hit.
* They can deal poise damage.
* They don't do damage.
* They can't crit. (Maybe?)
* They generally don't have talent tags.

What are 0 damage attacks:
* Some skill activations. (Hu Tao E, Xingqiu Q, Yoimiya Q, Zhongli Q)
* Some skill's orbitals. (Barbara E, Xingqiu E/Q)
* Alternate sprints.

How do normal attacks turn into 0 damage attacks:
* Immune attacks.
* Attacks against shields. The kind that grant full damage nullification until broken. (Mitachurl shields, Abyss Mages, Lectors.)

What do these attacks still retain:
* Attacks that are turned into 0 damage attacks retain their talent tags.
* They can still crit.
