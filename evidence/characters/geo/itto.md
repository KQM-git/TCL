## Normal Attack Mechanics

* Itto gains Superlative Superstrength stacks off field. - [Pablos\#1142](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPzBur_UzoY)
* Itto's Superlative Superstrength stacks persist through character swap. - [Pablos\#1142](https://youtu.be/xX5sCSvoxe4)
* Itto can Dragonstrike off of AK combo hits. - [BowTae\#0141](https://youtu.be/qM3Qtef8Tgk)

* Arataki Kesagiri has a big enough hitbox to affect enemies located behind Itto. - [Hitbox 1](https://youtu.be/SURWX7y43lc) | [Hitbox 2](https://youtu.be/ZV2zKhy6KPY) - Meatball\#0438 


## Skill Mechanics

* **Particles**: Itto Particle Generation is 3-4 with around a production ratio of 1:1. 100 attempts; 3 Particles = 53; 4 Particles = 47 - [CC\#5588](https://youtu.be/eaSw1TExI60)
  * Itto can pre-funnel particles from his Skill - [CC\#5588](https://youtu.be/6NqzXT4QQgQ)
* Ushi counts towards the Geo Construct Limit. - [CC\#5588](https://youtu.be/PmAEA9N5EiU)
* Ushi's duration starts at land and not on cast. - [MeCrush14\#2271](https://imgur.com/a/HcsL4z3)
* Ushi is unsuckable (via Sucrose and Kazuha). - [borderline\#3100](https://youtu.be/JVJnJ6QgR-g)
* Ushi can be pushed by either Itto or enemies. - [JonahFarc\#7056](https://i.imgur.com/4kIiqut.mp4)
* Hold E has 10sec timer. - [deRykcihC\#0551](https://youtu.be/TLT8XCE8ONg)
* Ushi still persists and gains stacks after teleporting. - [nxriaki\#6316](https://youtu.be/OLB4LVXzD-Q)
* Ushi is able to use wall hacks and phase through this wall in Mondstadt. Ushi will still despawn and give stack, so it doesnt get destroyed due to wall. - [Ultimate Noob\#2955](https://youtu.be/XluSNFbqGrg)


## Burst Mechanics

*  Itto Burst Snapshot Interaction with Different Stats - [CC\#5588](https://youtu.be/a54hQP4aYgU)
   * The video through various tests show that DEF is being snapshotted (Husk Set, Whiteblind, Gorou), while Geo DMG (Husk Set, Gorou, Ningguang) and ATK (Sara) aren't. It is unknown/unconfirmed at the moment this was submitted if Crit Buffs such as Gorou C6, Rosaria A4, and Traveler C1 are being snapshotted or not.
* Itto does not snapshot Gorou's buffs if you alt swap. - [tenten\#1010](https://youtu.be/qvgXZFJx63g)
*  Itto's Q can be hitlag extended. - ProfHugo\#6478
   * [No Hitlag - Q lasts 804 Frames](https://youtu.be/lwSMxN_bK98)
   * [Hitlag - Q lasts 846 Frames](https://youtu.be/aw06dCXAnjg)
* Itto's Q can expire during CA spam. - [ProfHugo\#6478](https://youtu.be/UPoTXD71MUs)
* Burst duration can significantly extend past its normal duration by doing an attack at the end of burst. This extension ends immediately on any action after the final attack, so it does not give you a meaningful burst extension beyond that final attack. - BowTae\#0141
   * [No attacks - burst ends at 6.0s CD](https://imgur.com/Pv6AMr4) \([Stats](https://imgur.com/OayN5yF)\)

### Itto N1 Burst Cancel SS Stack
**By:** Aftermath\#7658  
**Added:** 1/13/2022  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/929507146335408128/931064442861543434/transcript-itto-n1-burst-cancel-ss-stack.html)

**Finding:**  
Using Itto burst during N1 hitlag gives Superlative Strength Stack.

**Evidence:**  
Video and timing: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/9duP3w3)  
Itto gains Superlative Strength stacks on the frame that the damage numbers appear. So, if you use an N1 outside of burst and cancel the hitlag with Q before the damage number appears, the game will give you an SS stack from a burst N1.  

As this is ping-related, players with very low ping will only have a few frames in which to cancel into the burst.

**Significance:**  
There are several combo variants for Itto, a main category being first rotation 0 stack combos. With this tech, you can gain a stack early and go into the higher damage 1 stack combos without sacrificing dps from the extra non-Ult N1. It also serves as QoL to reduce the number of combo variants to remember.

## Utility Passive: Woodchuck Chucked

* Extra wood obtained from Itto's passive "Woodchuck Chucked" does not count towards daily 2000 tree cap.- Yukie\#7916

## Ascension Mechanics

### A1: Arataki Ichiban
* Itto has extremely high interruption resistance while using his special charged attacks. While doing his special charged attacks, Itto is able to take at least 9 hits from the Ruin Guard's spinning attack without getting staggered. - [mimiya\#9197](https://youtu.be/W1wdZ0LyzsI)

## Constellation Mechanics

### C2: Gather 'Round, It's a Brawl!
* Itto C2 counts himself as a geo user. - [ElliMiku#5071](https://youtu.be/wCvSY1Y11T4)

### C6: Arataki Itto, Present!

* At C6, Itto can do a kesagiri (not finisher) at 1 stack as it checks before the stack is consumed. C6 Itto cannot do an E>SCA Finisher combo like at all other cons and is heavily locked to spamming charged attacks the whole time. - [JonahFarc\#7056](https://imgur.com/6E0ol5h)

## Synergies/Interactions

*  Itto can almost consistently hit enemies lifted by Venti's Burst. - [CC\#5588](https://youtu.be/bHr2fCh4XHY)
   * Most of Itto's attacks (both normals, combos, and even his final slash) can hit enemies lifted by Venti's Burst due to them being more of vertical/diagonal strikes (and just having high enough of a vertical range in the case of the final slash aka the dunk) with the exception of N1. 
* Itto with Sacrificial Greatsword's passive can get 3 stacks. - [MeCrush14\#2271](https://imgur.com/a/TTNT12p)
* Ushi is able to interrupt Rifthounds during their backwards attack. - [Meatball#0438](https://youtu.be/zPA6uNLBhZA)
