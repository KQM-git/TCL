**Finding:**  
Ningguang’s E screen snapshots her stats on cast, and with Q use her personal gems will snapshot on Q cast while her screen’s gems will use her screen’s earlier snapshotted stats. This finding corrects the previous TCL finding that Ningguang’s Q does not snapshot, since the evidence for that finding did not account for the gems from her screen not receiving the buff they were using to test for snapshotting. 

**Evidence:**  
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7c4zvk6wXs) from elijam#7142  
Initial gems directly from Ningguang deal 774 damage, while gems from her E screen deal only 231 damage, due to Ningguang receiving Bennett's buff after E cast and snapshot.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocjfZ22VcHk) from Isu#6867  
Ningguang’s gems deal 129 on non crit, 203 on crit in an initial unbuffed reference cast. Ningguang receives Bennett buff, and then casts Q, losing Bennett buff after Q cast but while gems travel to target. Ningguang’s gems deal 861 on non crit, 1346 on crit despite losing Bennett buff before the gems connect. 

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xph9HrOD5U) and [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nowih1jXLpw) from Ai#7362  
First video shows Ningguang’s gems deal 441 on non crit, 1076 on crit in an initial unbuffed reference cast. Ningguang casts Q, then player pauses and eats an ATK boosting food while gems are still travelling to target. Ningguang’s gems deal 441 on non crit, 1076 on crit despite the ATK boost gained before gems connect. Second video shows Ningguang’s gems deal 492 on non crit, 1202 on crit with food buff. 

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROCJxmSsovM) from Ai#7362  
First run shows Ningguang cast E at one Lost Prayers stack, and Q at two. Personal gems deal 1545 on non crit, 3771 on crit. Gems from screen deal 1481 on non crit, 3616 on crit. Second run can be skipped. Third run shows Ningguang cast E (gem damage from screen difficult to see in this run, so not used as evidence for E screen snapshotting) and then cast Q while at two Lost Prayers stacks. Ningguang gains a third Lost Prayers stack while gems are still travelling to target, but gems still deal 1545 on non crit, 3771 on crit despite the Lost Prayers stack gained before gems connect. 

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUenM2hrNLI) and [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRDh0k7wF6U) from Bobrokrot#0111  
Both videos show Ningguang with a 100% crit rate from a fully stacked Royal Grimoire. All gems from both her screen and herself crit, despite her losing the 100% crit rate after the first crit gem connects due to how the Royal weapons series passive operates. 

**Significance:**  
Better rotation and team building for Ningguang surrounding setting up buffs for her E and her Q to snapshot.

### C2: Shock Effect

**Finding:**

Ningguang's Elemental Skill with her c2 activated has its effect put into cooldown when her E is used and the Sacrificial passive is procced, if the conditions were met to also proc her c2 effect \( Jade Shield present and broken by casting E \)

**Evidence:**

[\[Video\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyRlbb1E4Ew)

In the first example in the video, Ningguang's Elemental Skill is cast on an enemy, which procs the Sacrifical passive, resetting the cooldown. Then, it is cast again which destroys the original Jade Shield and procs her c2 effect resetting the cooldown.

In the second example, Ningguang's Elemental Skill is cast without any proc. Then, it is cast again \( with the previous Jade Shield present - destroying it \) proccing the Sacrificial passive, resetting the cooldown. Another cast of the Elemental Skill \( destroying the Jade Shield \) shows that the c2 effect has been put into cooldown, as it does not activate.

In the third example, Ningguang's Elemental Skill is cast without any proc. Then, it is cast again \( with the previous Jade Shield present - destroying it \) proccing the c2 effect and resetting the cooldown. It is cast a third time, which now procs the Sacrificial passive resetting the cooldown again.

**Significance:**

General knowledge on how these mechanics work, in reference to current or future abilities.
