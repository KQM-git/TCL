* Gauges
  * Elemental Skill: [1GU](https://youtu.be/DJ3uSEKgkW4) - Cryo aura 8.25s. Kaeya E applies 1.6B cryo; Gorou E removes 0.5 GU, leaving 1.1B Cryo 1.1B Cryo lasts 8.25s (edited) - Neptunya\#8291
  * Elemental Burst: Initial Hit [1GU](https://youtu.be/qkBwZtagqKo), Crystal Collapse 1GU
* ICDs - Nass008\#8577 
  * CA: Gorou fully-charged CA has no ICD/the ICD is shorter than fastest possible CA shots - [BowTae\#0141](https://youtu.be/NFpvCqMJiBM)
  * Burst: 1. initial hit and crystal collapse have separate ICD. Crystal Collapse follows normal ICD (2.5s) - [Nass008\#8577](https://youtu.be/oOMcBCHDC-Q)
* Particles
  * Elemental Skill: Gorou produces 2 geo particles on Elemental Skill cast. (I hope 7 tests is enough, ping pong me if it isn't and/or you get something other than 2 particles. - [Neptunya\#8291](https://youtu.be/QHq1Y_-asIw)
* Frames - pai#3602 
  * NA - [Youtube](https://youtu.be/LX0cAoBaqEM)
    * N1: 18
    * N2: 37
    * N3: 85
    * N4: 132
    *W ith Recovery: 162 
    * N3 and N4 from the second consecutive attack string can go up to 10-30 frames earlier than the first
  * Aimed Shot: 23 - [20 tests](https://youtu.be/GhIAYWSY-a8) 
  * Fully Charged Aimed Shot: 86 - [6 tests](https://youtu.be/xo5rOjbZ4Cs)
  * E - [Youtube](https://youtu.be/XihbafGI-Ak)
    * Press (5 tests): 46
    * Hold: (9 total tests): 62-649 
* Unlike most characters, Gorou does not keep one eye closed after ARCC. - [BowTae\#0141](https://youtu.be/_yuZ4lKpdKY)

## Normal Attack Mechanics

* Gorou can do the following aim tech - BowTae\#0141
  * Instant RR (enter and exit aim mode in 1 frame): [Youtube](https://youtu.be/mXEXYo7BGUA)
  * Hold M1 Double CA: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/c2cWS7KNOeI)
* Unlike most characters, Gorou does not keep one eye closed after ARCC (Yoimiya also does not). - [BowTae\#0141](https://youtu.be/_yuZ4lKpdKY)

## Skill Mechanics

* Gorou himself count for E buff condition. [Nass008\#8577](https://youtu.be/xQGDyQXzcxc)
* Gorou E and Q initial hit don't get the benefit of its own buff - [Nass008\#8577](https://youtu.be/lHvJM0ZFG4k)
* Gorou's E is unaffected by gravity. - [Aevean Leeow\#1362](https://youtu.be/ghbP5_aQwFQ)
* Gorou's zone has a delay before applying the buff (like Bennett's Q), the character receives the buff when the paw appears above their head - [Frost--Flame\#2563](https://youtu.be/n6-GLEQXT6g)

## Burst Mechanics

* Gorou's Crystal Collapse damage from his Elemental Burst doesn't snapshot. [Neptunya\#8291](https://youtu.be/DiPTvYLHR1A)
* Gorou E and Q initial hit don't get the benefit of its own buff - [Nass008\#8577](https://youtu.be/lHvJM0ZFG4k)
* Q initial hit (and A4 on initial hit) benefits from A1, but not Q buff, while Q collapse (and A4 on collapse) can benefit from A1 and Q buff. - [MeCrush14\#2271](https://youtu.be/lHvJM0ZFG4k) ([Stats](https://imgur.com/gZjNPRF))
* Gorou's Q buff lingers for 2 extra seconds. - [Vess\#7650](https://youtu.be/rsSJH9yUrOg)

## Ascension Mechanics

### A1: Heedless of the Wind and Weather
* Gorou's **Heedless of the Wind and Weather** (A1) only scales off of base defense stat. A1 will not scale off of additional defense values gained from artifacts and/or skills. [Trosalio\#0420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXI92moZFRc)

## Constellation Mechanics

### C1: Rushing Hound: Swift as the Wind
* Gorou's C1 CD eventually desyncs from his E CD, meaning you cannot proc it on every E cast. [Steno\#0119](https://imgur.com/a/yXHcZnm)
* Gorou's C1 can snapshot/Gorou's E and Q zone buff is delayed like Bennett's Q buff. To trigger C1 the character must deal geo damage while in the field, for characters with off-field abilities it just means they need to enter the zone and use the ability before going off-field.
In the second half of the video Albedo/Zhongli's E were used before they received the buff, meaning they weren't considered to be in gorou's E at the time of casting. - [Frost--Flame\#2563](https://youtu.be/O-HGSNkj478)

### C4: Lapping Hound: Warm as Water
* Gorou's C4 does not snapshot. - [Vherax\#5321](https://youtu.be/F-iLJL_9yQk)

### C6: Valiant Hound: Mountainous Fealty
* Gorou's C6 doesn't snapshot. - [JonahFarc\#7056](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/912910214699819028/921103967428182076/2021-12-16_12-09-26.mp4) ([Stats](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/912910214699819028/921103969521115136/unknown.png))
