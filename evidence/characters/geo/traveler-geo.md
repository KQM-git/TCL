## Multiple E Skill Resonance Can Hit 1 Target

**By:** The CEO of GEO\#7227

**Findings:** Resonating Geo Constructs with overlapping AoEs will multi-hit enemies

**Evidence:** [https://clips.twitch.tv/AdventurousAstuteWolfTriHard](https://clips.twitch.tv/AdventurousAstuteWolfTriHard)

**Significance:** Geo MC can make the most constructs on the game \(2 Meatballs which cap to 3 with Zhong Pillar, and 4 from Ult which don't count towards cap. This can turn small arenas into multi-hitting funzones.

## Twins CA MVs Comparison

**By:** Fluffy\#5580  
**Added:** 04/10/2021

**Theory:** Lumine is better than Aether because her CA 2nd hit multiplier is higher.

**Evidence:** Attached will be 2 images of T6 AA talent pages. The first will be Aether and the second will be Lumine. Using these values, and counting frames, I found that Aether has higher MV/s on N1, N2, N3, and N1C than Lumine but less on every other AA combo. My findings are in this sheet: [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14WkH2fd3fvGpHjGO7_A8xCJTy92WZsq0SL-tfEqXoXw/edit?usp=sharing)

**Significance:** Although, I wouldn't recommend using AA for either MC, Aether comes out on top with shorter AA combos which would be more preferred combos anyway. This means that while Lumine has on multiplier higher than Aether's, her AA is still worse than that of Aether. It really shouldn't matter unless you play main DPS though, so play who you want.

**Finding:**  
The Geo Traveler's Elemental Burst walls block a Geovishap from being able to jump over it.

**Evidence:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipBK9T1Thz8)  
As shown in the video, a Wake of Earth wall inbetween the Geovishap and the player completely prevent them from being able to jump over it, stopping their jump at the wall's edge.

**Significance:**  
Enemy movement manipulation when using Geo Traveler in a team comp.

## Geo MC C1 activation after Cast

**Finding:**
Geo MC C1 10% Crit rate buff becomes active after stone wall is created and does not affect the burst itself upon activation

**Evidence:**
[https://youtu.be/DBMJEKuABes]
Video shows geo MC with c6 and >90% crit rate not critting on 3rd hit of his Q.
If the crit bonus applied to burst damage, it would be impossible to not crit.

**Significance**
- Geo MC's burst does not apply C1 buff to its own damage (unless a ring from previous burst still exists)
- With C6 the duration of ring is 20s (with 15s cooldown), so it should be possible to maintain the buff on subsequent burst activations. However, as proven, the first elemental burst used will remain unaffected by C1 crit rate buff.

**Finding:**  
Geo Traveler can trigger Mistsplitter NA Stack with Frenzied Rockslide.

**Evidence:**

**Finding:**  
Anemo Traveler A4 counts as Normal Attack Damage.

**Evidence:**  

* [Youtube](https://youtu.be/JH6KsDqdsN8)
* ` .6 * 752 * (1 + .35) * .9 * ((100 + 80)/(100 + 85 + 100 + 80)) = 270.35`

**Significance:**  
Although a minor damage source, Geo Traveler's A4 Passive damage is increased by DMG bonuses towards Normal Attacks.
