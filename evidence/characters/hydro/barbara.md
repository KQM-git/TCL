## Skill Mechanics

### **Barbara E Animation Cancel**

**By:** RoaringMeow\#2437  
**Added:** 12/19/2020

**Finding:**

Reducing Barbara E animation for optimizing the "first heal"

**Evidence:**

* Just Switch: [https://youtu.be/8d4SAxy2yrM](https://youtu.be/8d4SAxy2yrM)  
* Just Switch and Beyond: [https://youtu.be/yBNpbQNPVgg](https://youtu.be/yBNpbQNPVgg)

**Significance**

A mechanic which is super useful to abuse the switch character cooldowns while using character's E between delays. So far I found only Barbara being able to do it consistently

Steps to Reproduce

* Switch to Barbara
* Press the button to swap to another character and immediately spam E

**Finding:**  
If a character dies at the same time the player switches characters, the death animation for the dead character will not activate, and neither will the revive from Barbara C6.  

**Evidence:**

The death animation and revive activates for Qiqi, but not for Aloy.

**Significance:**  
Barbara C6 is potentially worse as a safety net against death since it can be canceled by switching, which is common in regular play.
