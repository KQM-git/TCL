## 4pc Thundering Fury Effect Only Works if the Holder Procs the Reaction

**By:** Cenpi\#3224

The 4TF set effect adds 40% additional damage to electro-related reactions. In addition, everytime a reaction is proccd, the E CD is reduced by 1 second \(every 0.8s\).

The question is whether or not the holder must be the one proccing the reaction as opposed to a support.

For example, if Keqing has 4TF, applies electro, and Xiangling Guoba triggers overload, will this overload damage be increased by 40% or no?

The answer is no. In order to benefit from the increased damage, Keqing must be the one triggering the reaction.

This also applies for the cooldown reduction effect; Keqing must be the one triggering in order to get the cooldown reduction.

**Significance**

In solo PvE play, Keqing does NOT frequently trigger elemental reactions due to her high rate of application of electro.

Therefore, Keqing does not significantly benefit from the 4 set thundering fury effect.

## 4pc Thundering Fury’s 40% Reaction DMG Increase Works When Wearer is Off-Field

**By:** Boesik\#3192, Cenpi\#3224, Lix-\#3417

In short, yes. The 4 set TF increases reaction damage even if the holder is not on the field.

Note: No significant EM differences. Level differences are: Xiangling lvl 60; Fischl lvl 70

The following tests were conducted on a lvl 71 ruin guard:

Fischl proccing overload while present

Overload does 2066 damage

**Evidence**

Fischl proccing overload while not present

Overload does 2066 damage

See above video as well.

Xiangling proccing overload

Overload does 1077 damage

**Evidence**

Fischl \(with no 4 set\) proccing overload both while present and not present

Overload does 1476 damage regardless of whether Fischl is on field or not

Evidence \(for Fischl on field\)

Evidence \(for Fischl not on field\)

**Significance**

This finding means that you can put 4TF on a support and get the bonus damage to reactions even if they are not on the field.

## 4pc Thundering Fury Holder, if not on-field cannot Benefit from the CD Reduction

**By:** Boesik\#3192, Cenpi\#3224, Wrathior\#4848, Lix-\#3417

In short, no. The 4TF holder must be on the field to gain the benefit of the 1s CD reduction.

We know \(just to reaffirm\) that if the 4TF holder is on the field and proccing the reaction, the 1s CD reduction applies with every reaction

Xiangling using guoba on electro slimes shows each guoba tick reducing cd by 1 s.

**Evidence**

Xingqiu using his swords to reduce cd by 1s on electro slimes.

**Evidence**

### But if the 4TF holder is not on the field but proccing the reaction, the 1s CD reduction does not go through.

**Evidence**

In the video you can see that at roughly 2.33s into the video guoba is summoned with 11.9s CD.

2 overloads occur \(at 4s and 6s\)

At 8s into the video Xiangling is switched back in and guoba has a 6.2s CD

In total, roughly 5.33s has passed and guoba has only gone down in 5.7s

2s has not been reduced and the 0.37s can be equated to just human error in measuring timings.

This result also confirmed by Lix-\#3417 using Barbara E and then switching to Keqing, no CD reduction occurred.

**Significance**

4TF holders who trigger reactions while not on the field will not get the 1s CDR.

## Summons are Not Dynamic and Snapshot on Cast

Submitted by: Comfy Seaweed\#3841  
**Added:** 11/22/2020

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/-utEL05jfDg](https://youtu.be/-utEL05jfDg)

Oz's damage with no Bennett's Ult: 1695 \(no crit\), 2879 \(crit\)

Oz's damage with Bennett's Ult: 2180 \(no crit\), 3705 \(crit\)

We know that Bennett's ATK buff refreshes, and thus if Oz was Dynamic, Fischl would need to stay inside the AOE in order to obtain Bennett's ATK buff. However even when Fischl exits \(and thus losing ATK buff\), Oz's damage remains the same.

**Significance:** All buffs are not applied to summon\(s\) if you cast the buffs AFTER the summon\(s\) is already on the field.

### Re-snapshot: Resummoning Oz while he's still active re-snaphots Oz based on Fischl's buffs

Submitted by: JarJarThinks\#5411

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/61GvXHVc0D8](https://youtu.be/61GvXHVc0D8)

**Significance:**

This means that you can potentially update Oz's snapshot to reflect any new buffs, however this also means that if you resummon Oz after losing buffs, Oz will become weaker if he was previously snapshotted with buffs.

## Bow Users can use Aim Cancel

**Added:** 11/19/2020

To perform an aim cancel, after performing a normal attack string, double tap "R" or your aimed shot button.

When done correctly, this has potentially the fastest known way to perform animation cancelling, faster than even jump/hop cancels.

I haven't seen anyone so far mention this outside the usual jump cancel or dash cancel, and it may be helpful to bow carries perform their role more effectively with their normal attacks.

**Evidence:**

[https://youtu.be/5dwCpSyuxxw?t=23](https://youtu.be/5dwCpSyuxxw?t=23)

**Significance:**

Consider using aim cancelling for your DPS bow users, this would potentially up Childe and Fischl's DPS as main carry with the bow.

## Animation Cancel

Date of Submission: 12/28/2020  
Submitted By: alyk99\#2776

**Finding:**

AA-LMB hold outperforms AARR for Fischl

**Evidence:**

I will be using 2 videos to draw this conclusion, one per animation cancel type. For AARR, Youtuber TenTen demonstrates an AARR chain from his video on the cryo regisvine: [https://youtu.be/ydl9a01bRjM?t=5](https://youtu.be/ydl9a01bRjM?t=5)

One important thing should be noted here: The recording starts while he is already at max attack speed, meaning that this is at least probably the 2nd attack string. I'm not sure if there is any literature that references this, but there's a "higher attack count = attack faster" mechanic in this game. I'm not sure if it's related to just the attack count, enemy stagger/composure, or a combination of both.

TenTen scores 7 full combos in 5.5s

\(64.1% + 68.0% + 22% \* 2\) = 176.1% total MV per combo

\(176.1%\*7\)/5.5 = 224% MV per second.

In this video [https://i.imgur.com/rqX2Z5M.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/rqX2Z5M.mp4), I score 7 full combos \(with some misses\) from scratch in ~7.3s, but they include an additional aimed shot per combo.

\(64.1% + 68.0% + 22% \* 2+63.9\) = 240% MV per combo

\(240%7\)/7.3 = 230% MV per second

despite the difference seemingly being around 2.5% more damage dealt, the latter combo outperforms the former for qualitative and quantitative reasons.

**Qualitative:** In my experience, it's easier to pull off while dodging and in practice \(should be tested and verified as a general claim\). The headshot staggering enemies will allow you to avoid more damage as well.

**Quantitative:** The samples used to compare the combos had different conditions, in terms of danger and pre-accumulated attack speed. During the last section of my video, you can notice I am attacking faster than at the beginning. Specifically, I counted 108 frames i.e. 1.8s for 2 full combos, which yields a 240%2/1.8 = 266.7% MV/s , which would be a more fair number to compare to TenTen's, given the similarity in attack speed. Also the headshot is a guaranteed crit that can keep the prototype crescent up.

**Significance:**

Overall better animation cancel for AA Fischl found.

## Can Sucrose's Normal Attacks \(and by extension, Swirl reactions\) trigger Fischl's Lightning Smite?

Submitted by: Cola\#6861

I was asked this question on reddit and thought it should be the case since Sucrose' basic attacks are anemo which will swirl the electro debuff on the enemy.

Upon testing, as expected: it works, and yes Lightning Smite also crits!

**Evidence:**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyykxzJySIk&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyykxzJySIk&feature=youtu.be)

**Significance:**

One more reason to get Sucrose out in the field more often, at least for this use case.

## Fischl A1 Can Proc Prototype Crescent Passive

**By:** Charliex3000\#9403  
**Added:** 03/25/2021

**Finding:** Fischl A1 can proc prototype crescent passive on humanoids \(hitbox with weakpoint on top\)

**Evidence:**

* [Hilichurl](https://youtu.be/T9UzIzXbRyc)
* [Ruin Guard](https://youtu.be/P_hiz3GaK20) - usually it doesn't proc Prototype Crescent, but when you hit Oz in the head, it works.

**Significance:** Prototype Crescent rises up in weapon choice for a A1 charged shot focused Fischl build. Additionally, you can see that I need to aim to the side of Oz, because he doesn't count as a "target" so there is a parallax effect for aiming, requiring me to aim to the side to hit him.

## Fischl New MVs

**By:** ProfHugo\#6478  
**Added:** 03/25/2021

**Finding:** Fischl's MV/s ceiling is substantially higher than what was previously recorded.

**Evidence:**

This is a [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_H-LhIljb8) of 10 rotations of the AA-LMB combo \(no E\) with near frame-perfect input.

It took 486 frames, or 486 frames / 60fps = 8.1s to execute this rotation 10 times \(or 0.81s per combo\). Using the level 6 normal/charged attack talent values, Fischl's MV per AA-LMB combo is 64.1% + 68.0% + 63.8% + 22% \* 2 = 239.9% at C1+ without using E.

At 8.1s per 10 combos, this translates to \(239.9% \* 10\) / 8.1s = 296.17% MV/s. \(this breaks down to 241.85% MV/s from raw auto attacks and 54.32% MV/s from C1\)

Note that the above does not account for Fischl's E, so here are semi-rough estimations for her MV/s when Oz is summoned:

* **C1-2**: 241.85% MV/s + 124% MV/s = 365.85% MV/s \(66.11% PHYS, 33.89% ELECTRO\)
* **C3-5**:241.85% MV/s + 151% MV/s = 392.85% MV/s \(61.56% PHYS, 38.44% ELECTRO, T9 values for Fischl's E\)
* **C6**: 241.85% MV/s + \(30% MV  _2_  1/0.81s\) + 151% MV/s = 466.92% MV/s \(51.80% PHYS, 48.20% ELECTRO, T9 values for Fischl's E\)

**Significance:**

In alyk99\#2776's submission on December 28, 2020, they documented their AA-LMB personal output at 230% MV/s. This new value is substantially greater than what was previously documented and may push her over other dps options. The fact that she can output an outstanding level of MV/s consistently without the use of stamina and lower downtime may call for a re-evaluation of her status as a main dps, even without C6.

Note that as play-styles for Fischl differs between individuals \(some people only cast Q off cool down, while others do a quick E-Q chain, etc.\), on cast sources of damages are not considered here as those will vary drastically depending on playstyle.

**Editors Note:** These MV/s are not replicable by a normal player thus will not be accounted for in real world scenarios, but they do not invalidate the findings by alyk99\#2776.

## Fischl C6 + Innate Elemental Attacks in Turbo \(Turbo fixed in 1.5\)

**By:** Vye\#9195  
**Added:** 04/05/2021

**Finding:**

Innate pyro NA or infused pyro NA are unable to trigger Fischl A4 when attacking into an existing Fischl turbo reaction setup with Pyro. The same applies to an additional electro source like Beidou burst.

**Evidence:**

Setup is as follows:

* Turbo setup by using XL Pyronado and Fischl Oz call
* Klee who has innate pyro NA is equipped with 4 set thundering fury which lowers elemental skill CD if overload is procced
* After starting the turbo reaction Klee uses elemental skill E once and proceeds to NA cancel
* On Overload triggers no reduction of E skill is observed

[Pyro, XL, Fischl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GmoRvUytOY)

Setup for double electro with innate pyro NA or infused pyro NA:

* Turbo setup by using XL pyronado, Beidou burst and Fischl Oz call
* Character Klee who has innate pyro NA is equipped with 4 set thundering fury which lowers elemental skill CD if overload is procced
* After starting the turbo reaction Klee uses elemental skill E once and proceeds to NA cancel
* On Overload triggers no reduction of E skill is observed

[Pyro, XL, Fischl, 2nd Electro \(Beidou in this example\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhs9aXLO4Fc)

**Significance:**

In turbo compositions, using a pyro character with either innate pyro NA or infused pyro NA will not trigger Fischl A4. The same applies when adding an additional electro source like Beidou burst. We still cannot observe any overload reactions triggered by the on-field character through use of 4 TF.

## Fischl Turbo Superconduct Exploration \(Turbo fixed in 1.5\)

**By:** Vye\#9195  
**Added:** 04/05/2021

By using the turbo mechanic and adding a hydro unit you can create a team comp that utilizes the energy generation from turbo while also maintaining an 80% freeze uptime for your composition. Due to the constant superconduct this will also enable a potential physical carry for this team comp.

**Requirements:**

* Hydro unit for freeze, XQ seems best in slot
* 2 Cryo units who can out aura Oz for turbo mechanics
* Fischl to enable turbo energy regen

**Advantages:**

* Both cryo users and the hydro unit can take advantage of Blizzard Strayer which is worth ten 5\* tier 4 crit rate sub stats if both set effects are active
* cryo resonance crit rate bonus against enemies frozen or affected by cryo
* high freeze uptime means the enemy cannot fight back, which will lead to very effective dps application since you don't spend time dodging and/or repositioning

**Disadvantages:**

* expensive because most of the team needs investment
* currently we only have 2 Cryo units with Chong + Kaeya and neither can guarantee 100% cryo uptime to enable turbo fully so they need to be paired. A substitute would be cryo infused Venti or Sucrose bursts.
* limited ceiling due to the current quality of available cryo units

**Evidence:**

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su1kRSsEyt4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su1kRSsEyt4)
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz67t25BvTg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz67t25BvTg)

**Significance:**

Team comps that follow the blueprint of Hydro, Cryo, Cryo, Fischl would combine very high energy generation with freeze. These teams would be very effective when dealing with enemies with annoying or inconvenient move sets provided they can be frozen. The energy generation of turbo would let you run very low ER values, especially on ER hungry future Cryo or Hydro units. Additionally, Blizzard Strayer is an extremely good set in terms of the power it can provide to a character and can be utilized on 3 out of 4 units in these compositions.

**Additional Comments:**

Blizzard Strayer is applied off-field on abilities like XQ Q.

## Fischl E ICD

**By:** muakasan\#2792  
**Added:** 04/05/2021

**Finding:**

Determining Fischl's Elemental skill's ICD. Fischl's E \(Oz\) will apply electro every 4 hits or when a timer reaches 5 seconds after the first electro application. When the 5 second timer reaches zero, the oz's next hit will apply electro regardless of the hit counter. When the timer reaches 0 the hit counter will be reset and a new 5 sec timer will begin. This is very similar to auto attack ICDs, except instead of 3 auto attacks it is 4 oz hits, and instead of a 2.5 sec timer, it is a 5 sec timer.

**Evidence:**

## Fischl A4 Proc Rate

**Finding:**

Fischl's a4 proc rate appears to be less than 1 second, and instead seems to be 0.5s.

**Evidence:**

[\[Video\] Appears to be about 0.5s-0.6s cooldown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48Dg_i8PcYY) \(0.5s if judging from the first frame of each damage number appearing, 0.6s if judging from the first frame of the lightning bolt animation\)

## Fischl A4 Range tests

**Theory:**  
Fischl's A4 has a range centered around the triggering character, which is generally greater for characters with ranged attacks. When an attack at the edge of the range triggers an electro-related reaction Fischl's A4 can fail to trigger. Deployables are factored in to the range as well, such as Beidou Q or Oz himself.

**Evidence:**  
This was tested with Hu Tao's charge attack, the end of Noelle's greatsword swings under burst, and the end of Xiangling's Charge attack infused by Chongyun. A demonstration of how the range is variable by character is shown using Diluc's burst.

**Finding:** Fischl ult has a tiny window that you can use to iframe through attacks.

**Evidence:** [Video showing no HP loss when ruin guard lands](https://youtu.be/7RPfSWwUOLM0)

## Oz Summoned From Ult Snapshots Fischl's Stats When Swapped Out

**By:** Trosalio\#0420  
**Added:** 5/7/2020

**Theory:**  
When Fischl casts Midnight Phantasmagoria and then gets swapped out, she will leave Oz behind, who will take a snapshot of Fischl's stats the moment she leaves the field.

**Evidence:**  
I started off by casting Fischl skill to show his current dmg which was 665. Then at 00:08, I used Fischl burst and swapped off when she lost the atk buff. As you can see, Oz dmg was also 665. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SqSYT0QIb8)  
For the second video, I used Fischl burst, but swapped off before she lost the atk buff. This time, Oz dmg was 1791 which was higher than his previously expected skill dmg. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNS9SAwZY84)

**Significance:**  
Not only do you need to be careful about Bennett's atk buff tick interval, but also need to be careful not to let atk buff ran out before swapping out of Fischl.

## Fischl's C6 Procs 4pc Millelith

**By:** jdeeyu\#9927  
**Added:** 6/8/2021

**Finding:**  
Fischl's C6 counts as a proc for 4ToM's effect

**Evidence:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHcZD\_8Dog&ab\_channel=jdeeyu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHcZD_8Dog&ab_channel=jdeeyu)

In the video it shows Fischl's stats and equipment before proccing 4ToM, Oz is then summoned outside of his normal E range and doesn't do damage therefore not proccing 4ToM and C6 is used. As can be seen C6 does count as a proc for 4ToM. Oz is resummoned near the Ruin guard at the end to show that the damage that came from the first one was indeed from C6 and not from Oz's E shot \(~2k damage on E, ~350 damage on C6 proc\)

**Significance:**  
Normally not useful since Oz even without C6 should be enough to have 100% uptime on 4ToM while he's out. But there could be cases where Oz misses from some reason \(maybe an obstacle\) then C6 can cover for that and make 4ToM a bit more consistent. C6's Range is also larger than Oz's E shots so there could be fringe cases where Oz is out of range but you can still proc 4ToM using her C6.
