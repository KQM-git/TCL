  * Ice Cage stuck - [gengar#8426](https://imgur.com/a/qvQQSR5)
* Sara's Crowfeather has a "semi-taunt" mechanic, where it draws enemy attention - gengar#8426
  * [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/LCoyZGB): opponents are facing away from Crowfeather, but immediately walk towards it when it lands (even before entering combat mode)
  * [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/VLtVaOd): does not trigger enemy aggro/combat mode if sara's initial charged shot does not hit an opponent
  * [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/x227kWK): the range from which you can trigger enemy aggro (and enter combat mode) with crowfeather is different from a regular charged shot

### Crow feather interactions

**Finding:**  
Sara's ambush is the first 0 damage hit in the game for the purpose of triggering its buff on the player character (also AFAIK the first instance of friendly fire). This is exposing the difference between what skills care about being hit versus what skills care about taking damage. One (hard financially cause needs Jean c6) avenue to test this is to try out the 100% damage reduction team

**Evidence:**  
Does trigger:  
- Diluc C2 and Beidou C4  even with shield on. Diluc vids: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/Xgh6EvQGX_k), Beidou vids: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/VwD3jNS)  
- Zhongli A1 talent: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/VwD3jNS)

Doesn't trigger:  
- Serpent Spine: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/YVFJnqI)

**Significance:**  
Insights into feather application mechanics (maybe first 0 damage and friendly fire in game?) as well as clarification on what skills are actually on hit vs. taking damage.

### Burst Mechanics

* For Sara's ATK buff to apply on burst, a character has to be in a radius of the initial hit equal to the range of the Stormcluster hits. - Bobrokrot#0111
  * [No ATK buff](https://youtu.be/_vT-ZlQmqc8)
  * [Successful ATK buff](https://youtu.be/gC1d89Jmd9c), does not require getting hit by bolts.
* Titanbreaker targets closest enemy, then Stormcluster moves outward in a plus-shape with one branch directed at Sara’s location at time of cast. - [Wishiwashi#2548](https://imgur.com/a/313LEY4)
* Both Titanbreaker and Stormcluster damage is snapshot on Burst cast. - [Nass008#8577](https://imgur.com/skAgh1K)
* Sara's energy drain after burst cast occurs very late into her animation, meaning she can't be pre-funneled - Nass008#8577
  * [Keqing EE > Sara Q](https://imgur.com/oKrraKw)
  * [Beidou E > Sara Q](https://imgur.com/m72aQzM)
* Sara's Burst does not benefit from its own attack buff - Veggie#0581

### Ascension Mechanics

#### A4: Decorum

* The weaker Crowfeather from C2 can also trigger this effect. - [Bobrokrot#0111](https://youtu.be/8bRe0SvGUk8)

### Constellation Mechanics

#### C2: Dark Wings

* The weaker Crowfeather created from C2 can also proc Sacrificial Bow's passive. - [Monochrom9#8058](https://imgur.com/a/eAJPXf9)
* Weaker Crowfeather snapshots upon Tengu Stormcall cast. - [Nass008#8577](https://imgur.com/lCvoNe6)
* The weaker Crowfeather formed can trigger the effects of Sara's A4. - [Bobrokrot#0111](https://youtu.be/8bRe0SvGUk8)

#### C6: Sin of Pride

* The effects of C6 do not get snapshot. - [Choatic#7774](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4ENm19DOPY)

### Tech

* Sara turns to face nearby enemies after casting her skill. - [Wishiwashi#2548](https://imgur.com/a/DJJiGi0)
  * PC and Controller players can take advantage of this to quickly turn the camera (e.g., with middle mouse button, PS4 R3 button) and CA to place the crowfeather towards the enemy.

### Fluff

* Crowfeather doesn't alarm wild animals. - [gengar#8426](https://imgur.com/a/qkHJaOv)

#### Double Buff with Sara C2

**By:** NZPIEFACE#8439 and BowTae#0141

Discussion in Basic Mechanics

**Finding:**  
It's possible to buff 2 different characters, with one Crowfeather from C2 and another from Sara's charged attack without needing to swap back to Sara after charged shot.

**Evidence:**

* [Youtube](https://youtu.be/614ud7vKz4Q)
* [Imgur 30 fps](https://imgur.com/lDx2hSL)
* [Imgur 60 fps](https://imgur.com/BjHFzqv)

**Significance:**  
This is possible to perform without cancels but the timing is extremely difficult.

### Double Snapshot with Sara's Burst

**By:** Wishiwashi#2548  
**Added:** 9/7/2021  
Discussion in Basic Mechanics

**Finding:**  
It's possible to have two different characters snapshot Sara’s burst ATK buff by following Stormcluster with precise positioning/timing. See evidence below for video of 3 attempts.

**Evidence:** [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/DIYQPrQ)

**Significance:**  
This technique is too difficult to pull off consistently to be recommended for normal gameplay purposes. Also, this only worked because I used Fischl/Beidou, who have short animation times here. This is more of an exercise in pushing Sara’s limits.

It may be easier to pull off double snapshots with C2, or at C0/C1 with a rotation like Sara ECA > Swap to Fischl > Wait for Ambush buff > Fischl E > Burst-Quickswap Sara Q > Swap to Beidou > Wait for Stormcluster buff > Beidou Q
