## Basic Mechanics ##

### Razor frame data

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mKV6mZknfmBx04iUzfBYfWggWNbZACPyTnTMpWlWSHc/edit\#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mKV6mZknfmBx04iUzfBYfWggWNbZACPyTnTMpWlWSHc/edit#gid=0)


## Burst Mechanics

### Does Razor retain his Electro aura from his Q after swapping off and back on?

**By:** EternalDream\#5503

**Finding:**  
Razor retains his Electro aura from his Burst for a short time when switched off before burst ends \(around 2 seconds\). When switched back to, the aura can still react with other self-inflicted auras such as Bennett Q or Diona E before it disappears.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
Just something to keep in mind when switching off Razor before his burst fully ends, and back to him in a short timeframe when fighting in aura-applying areas that react with Electro, as switching back to Razor too quickly may apply overload/electro-charged/superconduct to him outside of his burst.

### How does Hitlag affect Razor’s Q?

**By:** shdwbld\#8103

**Finding:**  
Razor Q duration is affected by Hitlag. The more hitlag, the longer the duration.

**Evidence:**  
* [https://youtu.be/t86Ac4t3Zhg](https://youtu.be/t86Ac4t3Zhg)

**Significance:**  
You can essentially have 100% ult uptime if it were not for no particles during Q. You can have your Q CD done \(20 seconds\) by the time your Q duration is done if hitlag is high enough. Hitlag can also extend the duration of both buffs and debuffs, like Superconduct and Razor C1 and C4.

## Constellation Mechanics

### C6: Lupus Fulguris

#### Razor’s C6 damage

**Finding:**  
Razor’s C6 damage instance has no ability type scaling tags.

**Evidence:**  
Testing done by Peekays\#2722  
* Damage is consistent with and without 4HoD bonus - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=devW07AbLM0)  
* Damage is consistent with and without 2gambler bonus - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_nh1IvnrxY)  
* Damage is consistent with and without 2NO bonus - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h6EC1ZR2nY)  

**Significance:**  
Damage calculations for Razor.

## Interactions/Synergies

### Cryo attacks trigger AoE Superconduct during Q

**By:** Araetha\#9163

**Finding:**  
Superconduct triggered by enemy Cryo attacks while Razor's Lightning Fang is active affects nearby enemies as well as Razor.

**Evidence:**  
* [https://youtu.be/3vX6LxGrkGc](https://youtu.be/3vX6LxGrkGc)

**Significance:**  
This provides more uptime for Superconduct in floor 12 and, if utilized, gives a possibility to have Superconduct for the entire duration of Lightning Fang

### Pyro abilities \(e.g. Bennett Q\) trigger AoE Overload during Q

**By:** Shifu02\#7738

**Finding:**  
Bennett’s ult cleanse can react with Razor’s ult cleanse to proc overload on yourself. This effect does not harm you, but it deals two ticks of damage and knocks small mobs back.

**Evidence:**  
* [https://streamable.com/5jnl7q](https://streamable.com/5jnl7q)
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr5UVwdV4AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr5UVwdV4AA)

**Significance:**  
For those people who want to bring Bennett in the same team as Razor, this is one thing to consider in situations like overworld. The overload can knock back enemies out of Bennett’s ult, but it can also work as a little of extra damage to mobs that can’t be knocked back.

## Calculations/Resources

### Tap E vs. Hold E against single enemy?

**By:** Tetragram\#6983

**Theory:**  
To find rather it's better to do a press or hold on Razor's E against one enemy in terms of damage.

**Evidence:**  
* The ratio of press to hold damage is 0.675092612 to 1.
* E press animation took 0.55 seconds.
* E hold animation took 0.85 seconds.
* The dps ratio from E press to E hold is 1.043324946 to 1. 

All my research and calculations: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b7U7QuuB7\_4n-v8CHSWnHeyWxOzhCauVpE5leM4ydfg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b7U7QuuB7_4n-v8CHSWnHeyWxOzhCauVpE5leM4ydfg/edit?usp=sharing)

**Significance:**  
I found that press would deal 4.33% more damage to hold on Razor's E against a single enemy if you input a second command to the enemy the instant the animation finishes. Since there is a 0.3 animation difference between press and hold, if you input a second command within 0.3 seconds you would still deal more damage.

### 3 hit combo or 4 hit combo?

**By:** Tetragram\#6983 and Shifu02\#7738

**Theory:**  
To find if Razor had a higher DPS on 3 hit or 4 hit combo without burst form \(Q\).

**Evidence:**  
* The ratio of the 4 hit damage sum to the 3 hit damage sum is about 1.48 \(holds true at all talent levels\)
* The overall 3 hit animation was 1.889 seconds
* The overall 4 hit animation was 3.144 seconds
* The overall animation ratio of 4 hit to 3 hit is about 1.664.

All my research and calculations: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D991QGBGmGnlPDJnB7VyQ0TdZ3tZ1-dzUpGcgQB2sPY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D991QGBGmGnlPDJnB7VyQ0TdZ3tZ1-dzUpGcgQB2sPY/edit?usp=sharing)

**Significance:**  
Since the animation ratio is greater than the damage ratio this tells us that the 3 hit combo will always have a higher DPS than the 4 hit combo. Also credit to @Shifu02 for helping me do some tests.

NOTE: this finding has been amended due to recent tests: 4 hit is now generally better in Q due to reduced animation time between the 3rd and 4th hit. See the Razormains Comprehensive guide for more details here: [https://bit.ly/37H9SZ1](https://bit.ly/37H9SZ1).

### 3 hit + E or 4 hit?

**By:** Fozbos\#3469

**Theory:**  
To find if 3 hit + E press or 4 hit in terms of dps is better without burst form \(Q\).

**Evidence:**  
* [https://imgur.com/a/Ldvevud](https://imgur.com/a/Ldvevud)

**Conclusion**:  
3 hit + E is better than 4 hit. An ideal combo would be to use E + 3 hits + 3 hits + E.

### How many frames in E normal attack vs E burst attack?

**By:** Avs\#5138

**Finding:**  
Regular E:

Test 1, 1.15 = 75 frames Test 2, 1.07 = 67 frames Test 3, 1.07 = 67 frames Test 4, 1.12 = 72 frames Test 5, 1.12 = 72 frames Test 6, 1.07 = 67 frames Test 7, 1.22 = 82 frames Average frames of 7 tests = 71.71 frames for E

Burst E:

Test 1, 1.16 = 76 frames Test 2, 1.15 = 75 frames Test 3, 1.16 = 76 frames Test 4, 1.29 = 89 frames Test 5, 1.19 = 79 frames Test 6, 1.18 = 78 frames Test 7, 1.16 = 76 frames Test 8, 1.16 = 77 frames Average frames of 8 tests = 78.25 frames for E during Q burst

**Conclusion**:  
The animation is different and slightly slower during burst. It is not affected by the 40%+ normal ATK SPD bonus \(or else it would be faster, or if it was, the different animation would be longer and then reduced to 78.25 frame average\).

### Razor Dragonstrike MV/s

**Finding:**  
Razor DS combos and E rotations have substantial mv/s increase from standard attack strings outside of Q.

**Evidence:**  
All data and video evidence found in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_UxetY_-Zz-4kh59CfxkNhKgmJbiEsBrfgsttDVGKTg/edit?usp=sharing)

**Significance:**  
Assuming no ICD based sub-dps are used, DS combos show a range from roughly 35-49 percent mv/s increase. (More elaboration on spreadsheet)
