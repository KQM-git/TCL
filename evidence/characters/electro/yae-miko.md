## Attack Mechanics

* NA is considered an AoE attack. - [Video](https://youtu.be/ook_T0bjpsM) - TheFirstRapher\#9207
* NA doesn't track teleporting enemies. - [Video](https://youtu.be/TNLEqmPQWw0) - emmaus\#9072
* NA and CA can both hit through walls. - [Video 1](https://youtu.be/jk4UO-rlnuA) / [Video 2](https://youtu.be/e6y80OXzpfg) - Wesu\#8719
* CA can hit the same enemy twice if the hitbox is large enough. - [Video](https://imgur.com/3z4irnj) - Vess\#7650

## Skill Mechanics

* Particles - [Video](https://youtu.be/WVk9Xu6AwR8) - pai\#3602
  * 1 (-) every hit of the Sesshou Sakura.
  * It's the same amount regardless of the amount of Sesshou Sakuras on-field or the level.
  * Each Sesshou Sakura hits 5 times, each with independent timing.
  * The first hit occurs 1.5s after E is casted.
  * The following hits occur every 2.9s.
  * When there is more than 1 Sesshou Sakura on-field, particles are generated only from the first one that was placed.
* Sesshou Sakura hits shield even from behind the enemy. - [Video](https://imgur.com/zDEETHu) - Vess\#7650
* Casting E three times in a straight line does not allow the outside two turrets to become level 3; only the middle turret will become level 3. - [Video](https://youtu.be/CZF2wjkZlp8) - Ayzel\#7399
* Sesshou Sakura has a small AoE and can only hit multiple enemies when they are tightly grouped up. - [Video](https://youtu.be/agLxIAtHiuw) - Abyssight\#1393
* The dash does not have i-frames; Yae Miko places down a Sesshou Sakura where she is hit during a dash. - [Video 1](https://youtu.be/xxqmC3yLSCU) / [Video 2](https://youtu.be/0btyoPTCAoo) - Chaiyune\#7349
* When Yae Miko dies from a hit while during the dash, no Sesshou Sakura will be placed and the Elemental Skill still goes on cooldown. - [Video](https://clips.twitch.tv/ManlyClumsyKleeMrDestructoid-Yb3ACTKZ9XK3O4PZ) - Chaiyune\#7349
* When using the Elemental Skill 3 times in a row, all 3 Sesshou Sakuras will become level 3 before any of them fires. - [Video](https://clips.twitch.tv/CourteousTriumphantShingleDatSheffy-XcmVj4ZFVzdfHJqD) - Neptunya\#8291
* Yae Miko dashes backwards and leaves a Sesshou Sakura in the place the Elemental Skill is used, unless a direcctional key is being held down, in which case she will dash in the direction that she is moving towards. - [Video](https://youtu.be/XD6DdHkbGq4) - borderline\#3100
* The Sesshou Sakuras despawn when Yae Miko dies. - [Video](https://clips.twitch.tv/InterestingFrailSwanSoBayed-e3ZVv_yBxllpbNgf) - Neptunya\#8291
* Using E allows Yae Miko to escape Mirror Maiden's cage. - [Video](https://youtu.be/ktm5TvioKIw) - emmaus\#9072
* The level and limit for the amount of Sesshou Sakuras is shared in CO-OP. - [Video](https://imgur.com/a/jLNr6vE) - hiimandrei\#6690
* Sesshou Sakura can be deployed mid-air using a moving platform and stay in the air. - [Video](https://youtu.be/Q183ocU-id4) - Char11\#6024

## Burst Mechanics

* Tenko Kenshin is completely stationary, and the Tenko Thunderbolts' locations are always in front of Yae Miko and are independent of Sesshou Sakuras' locations. - [Video](https://imgur.com/a/beg3YSm) - Asaki\#9139
* The Tenko Kenshin targetting occurs at the end of the Elemental Burst animation. - [Video](https://clips.twitch.tv/OpenDeterminedSproutTTours-wv0CPNVI7FKKbplb) - Neptunya\#8291
* Elemental Particles and Orbs can be pre-funneled to Yae Miko. - [Video](https://clips.twitch.tv/SaltyVenomousDaikonRaccAttack-yhEQ0GQxu4o_epc7) - Neptunya\#8291
* Tenko Kenshin unseals all Sesshou Sakuras in CO-OP, regardless of the original ownership. The damage of Tenko Thunderbolts is based on the stats of the player that casts the Elemental Burst. - [Image](https://imgur.com/yez4INl) - Alarar\#6877
* Sesshou Sakuras are unsealed instantly when casting the Elemental Burst. - [Video](https://youtu.be/i01OBfC0YY4) - Bobrokrot\#0111
