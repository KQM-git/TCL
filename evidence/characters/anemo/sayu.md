### Skill Mechanics

* Sayu's roll is affected by movement speed buffs. - [Hikaru#8338](https://youtu.be/zlPtLamzvVg)
* Sacrificial does not proc on hold E Windwheel hits, it can only proc on Fuufuu Whirlwind Kick - [Steph#3614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_QoytoKyZw)
* Sayu's Elemental Skill can be used at 0 stamina, and does not consume nor gain any stamina during the roll. - [EdisonsMathsClub#6469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EboCmsXMfIo&feature=youtu.be)
* Absorption Priority is: Pyro > Hydro > Electro > Cryo - [채z#0007](https://youtu.be/E8hTyByWYF0)
* If Sayu gets frozen while rolling, she will still deal Windwheel damage - [Mcpie#8672](https://youtu.be/HawcofVHV6I)
* Sayu is capable of ice bridging if her roll is infused with cryo. - [Dunkingson#9351](https://imgur.com/a/gUFyt8Y) 
* Sayu's Hold E follows standard ICD (3-hit/2.5s) - [sigurd#3854](https://youtu.be/ko1xQoItN30)
* Sayu has separate ICD on anemo application for her Windwheel Roll and Whirlwind Kick. - [DeFault#1802](https://youtu.be/ssYgLkdNzq8)

  * Swapping Characters - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/SUEmTnj.mp4)

### Burst Mechanics

* Sayu can absorb pre-fed particles during her elemental burst animation - [Nass008#8577](https://youtu.be/bdHedirf9VA)
  * Works for both Tap and Hold E
* The summoned Daruma can be pushed around by characters or enemies, also moving its healing/attack range. - [pox#1832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwFdbiW44Us) and [Mcpie#8672](https://youtu.be/V2C8a2WLugk)
* Sayu's Elemental Burst snapshots. - [Nass008#8577](https://youtu.be/rK3JGXBc-eo)
* Sayu's Elemental burst can reach Venti's ult & hit consistently. - [채z#0007](https://imgur.com/a/QPWqZbh)
* The Daruma works the same way as Guoba - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/UweRgyV.mp4)
  * Doesn't light up in elemental sight, is movable, cannot get infused, etc.
* Sayu's Burst has separate ICD on her burst's initial hit and Daruma damage ticks - [DeFault#1802](https://youtu.be/KLy1f8aKkBg)
  * The summoned Daruma deals 7 ticks of Anemo Damage in a small AoE - [Zakharov#5645](https://imgur.com/a/wyIaelB)
  * The Daruma Damage ticks follow standard ICD
  * This means Sayu can swirl 5 times during her burst (1 from cast + 4 from Daruma)\

### Passive Mechanics

#### Passive: Yoohoo Art: Silencer's Secret

* Passive works even if Sayu is off-field - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/xUpatkg.mp4)
* If entities are connected (like crystalflies), then picking them up will always scare the others - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/wjFjETt.mp4)
* If entities do not care about the state of other beings, then picking it up next to another one won't startle them - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/xUpatkg.mp4)
* Sayu's passive does not affect coop members - works only for your own party - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/i41t4tD.mp4)
