### Skill Mechanics

* Sayu's roll is affected by movement speed buffs. - [Hikaru#8338](https://youtu.be/zlPtLamzvVg)  
* Sayu's roll snapshots [1](https://youtu.be/fM_7247lDqk) [2](https://youtu.be/XrN4D5es3-g) - chae#0720  
* Sacrificial does not proc on hold E Windwheel hits, it can only proc on Fuufuu Whirlwind Kick - [Steph#3614](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_QoytoKyZw)
* Sayu's Elemental Skill can be used at 0 stamina, and does not consume nor gain any stamina during the roll. - [EdisonsMathsClub#6469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EboCmsXMfIo&feature=youtu.be)
* Absorption Priority is: Pyro > Hydro > Electro > Cryo - [채z#0007](https://youtu.be/E8hTyByWYF0)
* If Sayu gets frozen while rolling, she will still deal Windwheel damage - [Mcpie#8672](https://youtu.be/HawcofVHV6I)
* Sayu is capable of ice bridging if her roll is infused with cryo. - [Dunkingson#9351](https://imgur.com/a/gUFyt8Y) 
* Sayu's Hold E follows standard ICD (3-hit/2.5s) - [sigurd#3854](https://youtu.be/ko1xQoItN30)
* Sayu has separate ICD on anemo application for her Windwheel Roll and Whirlwind Kick. - [DeFault#1802](https://youtu.be/ssYgLkdNzq8)
* Sayu Hold E can be cancelled out of by...
  * Dash Cancelling - [RazorClaws#4343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwKnua1AOCI)
  * Jump Cancelling - [RazorClaws#4343](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWDobcF8vpg)
  * Swapping Characters - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/SUEmTnj.mp4)  
* Sayu's E roll keeps on rolling if you want to answer or write a message. Finally a way to perform "autowalk". Works in coop as well. - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/bbliYsk.mp4)  
* Sayu's roll E kick performs autotarget during unroll. - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/AmJdNSP.mp4)  
* Sayu's roll continues during cinematics. - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/GH6nirt.mp4)  
* Sayu's kick onto a crystal ore will make it require only 3 more hits rather than 4. - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/1OqLOWP.mp4)  

### Burst Mechanics

* Sayu can absorb pre-fed particles during her elemental burst animation - [Nass008#8577](https://youtu.be/bdHedirf9VA)
  * Works for both Tap and Hold E
* The summoned Daruma can be pushed around by characters or enemies, also moving its healing/attack range. - [pox#1832](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwFdbiW44Us) and [Mcpie#8672](https://youtu.be/V2C8a2WLugk)
* Sayu's Elemental Burst snapshots. - [Nass008#8577](https://youtu.be/rK3JGXBc-eo)
* Sayu's Elemental burst can reach Venti's ult & hit consistently. - [채z#0007](https://imgur.com/a/QPWqZbh)
* The Daruma works the same way as Guoba - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/UweRgyV.mp4)
  * Doesn't light up in elemental sight, is movable, cannot get infused, etc.
* Sayu's Burst has separate ICD on her burst's initial hit and Daruma damage ticks - [DeFault#1802](https://youtu.be/KLy1f8aKkBg)
  * The summoned Daruma deals 7 ticks of Anemo Damage in a small AoE - [Zakharov#5645](https://imgur.com/a/wyIaelB)
  * The Daruma Damage ticks follow standard ICD
  * This means Sayu can swirl 5 times during her burst (1 from cast + 4 from Daruma)\

### Passive Mechanics

#### Passive: Yoohoo Art: Silencer's Secret

* Passive works even if Sayu is off-field - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/xUpatkg.mp4)
* If entities are connected (like crystalflies), then picking them up will always scare the others - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/wjFjETt.mp4)
* If entities do not care about the state of other beings, then picking it up next to another one won't startle them - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/xUpatkg.mp4)
* Sayu's passive does not affect coop members - works only for your own party - [Mcpie#8672](https://i.imgur.com/i41t4tD.mp4)

### Constellation Mechanics

#### Sayu C2 infused kick

**Finding:**  
The stated DMG increase of Fuufuu Whirlwind Kick from Sayu's C2 increases both Anemo Kick Hold DMG and Absorbed Element Kick DMG, by 3.3% every .5s tick

**Evidence:**  
Using a Sayu with 80/80 r1 Sac GS, no artifacts (713 atk, 72 em), talent level 1 skill

In the first video, Sayu rolls at 24s, kicks at 26s, and the resulting ~2s roll deals 752 anemo and 263 pyro.  
In the second video, Sayu rolls at 8s, kicks at 18s, and the resulting ~max length roll deals 1137 anemo and 398 pyro.

Rough napkin maths:  
base anemo hold kick dmg: 716  
base absorbed element kick dmg: 251

2 roll ticks anemo hold kick dmg: 716 * (1 + 2 * 0.033) = 763  
2 roll ticks abs elem kick dmg: 251 * (1 + 2 * 0.033) = 267

20 roll ticks anemo hold kick dmg: 716 * (1 + 20 * 0.033) = 1188  
20 roll ticks abs elem kick dmg: 251 * (1 + 20 * 0.033) = 416
