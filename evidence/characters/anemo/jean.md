## Attack Mechanics

### Jean CA Visual Effect
**By:** ASnowOwI\#7234  
**Added:** 12/30/2021  

**Finding:** Jean's CA visual and audio effect will appear on more than just enemies, as well as even appearing on enemies that don't get lifted at all.

**Evidence:** 
* Torch: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/URAVSQvPUCs)
* Ruin Guard: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/ZzQ-FhWjO3w)
* Haybales and Cooking Pot: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/KHEDUlbdGvQ)
* Parametric Transformer (activated and not activated):

**Significance:** Fluff.

## Skill Mechanics

### Gale Blade's Pull effect's Dependence on Level Difference

**By:** Michael/mSoo\#1561

**Theory:**  
Tested this with Jean level by level. For Gale Blade to continually be able to pull opponents, it seems a level difference below or equal to 20 is required.

**Evidence:**

* [Lvl 74 Jean vs lvl 95 Hillichurl, where target Hilichurl isn't lifted](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/765191980115689542/794809136244195339/unknown.png)
* [Lvl 75 Jean vs lvl 95 Hillichurl, where target Hilichurl is lifted](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/765191980115689542/794809333057454091/unknown.png)

**Significance:**  
Leveling your Jean to 80 is necessary if you want to abuse fall damage on Level 100 enemies on Floor 12 of Spiral Abyss

### Fall Damage Basis from Gale Blade

**By:** Wrax\#7777  
**Added:** 12/1/2020

**Theory:**  
The damage caused by Jean's Elemental Skill, Gale Blade, from falling is a percent based on the target maximum health. These percentage value ranges are based on velocity of the fall rather than the height.

**Evidence:**  
For the two below clips, we are comparing the damages dealt for simply pulling them to the ground after Jean's Charged Attack, and for when they are flung high up in the air with Jean's Elemental Skill.

* [Lvl 69 Hilichurl](https://youtu.be/fG90rk8K6-U) 
  * Damage of 2.2k, for pulling the target to the ground after Jean's Charged Attack
  * Damage of 2.1k, for flinging the target high up in the air with Gale Blade
* [Lvl 70 Fatui Cicin Mage](https://youtu.be/EYO5-SCBH7Q) 13.4k, 12.5k
  * Damage of 13.4k, for pulling the target to the ground after Jean's Charged Attack
  * Damage of 12.5k, for flinging the target high up in the air with Gale Blade

In the clip below, the second time Gale Blade is used, the target flew and was thrown at a slight arc rather than straight up. This resulted in reduced damage.

* [Lvl 90 Fatui Cicin Mage \(in Midsummer domain\)](https://youtu.be/v0ShwTzt9Fg)
  * Damage of 39.4k, for pulling the target to the ground after Jean's Charged Attack
  * Damage of 22.9k, for flinging the target at an arc with Gale Blade

I believe that the large gap in damage is sufficient evidence to claim that the slam/fall damage is a percentage based on the target's maximum health. Damage isn't boosted by Superconduct.

* [Evidence that its based on max hp](https://youtu.be/B1a3mCpDGkc)
  * Damage of 57k in the beginning when target had full hp 
  * Damage of 53k at the end when target had only a sliver of health

**Significance:**

* Pulling the target to the ground using Gale Blade rather than launching them results in similar damage applied faster.
* If choosing to launch target for crowd-control reasons, then make sure that the target is sent straight up in order to inflict the most damage.

### Jean Hold E Fall Damage Inconsistent

**By:** xf3\#3123 and Zeitraffer\#1074

[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/830897860743921664/835374730487398460/transcript-gale-blade-fall-dmg-inconsistency.html)

**Findings:**  
Jean's Held Gale Blade produces inconsistent fall damage numbers when compared to Tap Gale Blade. Fall Damage on enemies is inconsistent while fall damage on objects is not.

**Evidence:**  
[Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_PrFk3jhc-vsoz66z4z61DJ_ZvYajBMvchFOxlhuvM0/edit#gid=0)

Jean's Gale Blade: "At the cost of continued stamina consumption, Jean can command the whirlwind to pull surrounding opponents and objects towards her front."

In the sheet, there are two tests, one for Gale Blade on Baron Bunny and on an Abyss Mage with a video demonstration of the method used.

For the Baron Bunny tests, Held Gale Blade produced slightly inconsistent fall damage numbers compared to Tap Gale Blade's consistent numbers. For the Abyss Mage tests, both variations of Gale Blade produced inconsistent numbers, however, the disparity for Held Gale Blade's numbers were far greater than Tap Gale Blade's numbers.

The inconsistent fall damage from the Held version of Gale Blade is likely to be something caused by the small disturbances happening while holding a target. As such it can also be negated by simply doing a Sucrose Counter Yeet \(yes, I called it that\) which will force the target to come crashing down at maximum speed which will remove the massive inconsistencies of a normal Jean Yeet.  
[Example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/830897860743921664/835099004857483274/Jean_Yeet_Test_Results.mp4)

**Significance:**  
Illustrates that Jean's Held Gale Blade produces inconsistent numbers compared to Tap Gale Blade. Jean players, and likely other fall damage abusers, will have to take this into consideration for their strategies as it could effect abyss runs against lightweight enemies. So far, the most likely reason is how Jean's Held Gale Blade holds enemies in front of her, causing small changes in velocity/height. Other reasons would be tied to how fall damage as a whole works, relating to velocity, hitbox collision, landing angle, etc.

_Additional Notes:_  
Further proves that fall damage is based on velocity, not height \(however greater height causes more acceleration\). Also proves that objects \(such as Baron Bunny\) have different hitboxes than enemies when calculating fall damage. Also, some instances of fall damage are drastically lower. This is likely due to a bug.

### Fall Damage Is Influenced By Poise

**By:** ColaSenami#5312    
**Added:** 6/20/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/850586648760549377/856383288956813342/transcript-jean-fall-dmg-60-pct-better-stagger.html)

**Finding:**  
The velocity from fall dmg can be influenced by interrupt resist or poise, and can increase fall dmg to 160%. 

**Evidence:**  
Original clip is from xf3, then made to edit to make it side by side. In the video below it shows an abyss mage with 0 poise (stunned/staggered) vs an abyss mage with 2.25 poise. mage at 0 poise was launched at higher velocity than the mage who is dancing. This is easily reproducible.  
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVPetqEeJU4)

**Significance:**  
Before launching an opponent with Jean E, reduce its poise to 0 and stagger them first, then watch your fall dmg hit higher numbers.

## Burst Mechanics

### Continuous Self-Swirl and Cleanse

**By:** KDacus\#2865  
**Added:** 3/21/2021

**Findings:**  
Jean's Elemental Burst, Dandelion Breeze, repeatedly Swirls every character in the area if they have an Aura element on them. Should the same character stand on Bennett's Elemental Burst, Fantastic Voyage, it will trigger a Swirl reaction every second and apply Pyro to all surrounding enemies.

**Evidence:**  
[https://youtu.be/f-fzwDOYL6I](https://youtu.be/f-fzwDOYL6I)

**Significance:**  
Very consistent aura application. Can be used for Cryo or Hydro main carries or Overload setups in conjunction with Bennett.

### Anemo Aura

**By:** ProfHugo#6478  
**Added:** 6/14/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/853336250898579476/854032596726972456/transcript-anemo-aura.html)

**Finding:**  
Anemo can be the aura for swirl during Bennett-Jean Sunfire under very specific circumstances

**Evidence:** <https://youtu.be/ZEQdmWjMBNM?t=16>   

At 0:16-0:17, Bennett's Q applied pyro shortly after Jean Q applied anemo on the active character (Kaeya). This caused Bennett to become the trigger for swirl, causing a sunfire pulse which was vaporized for 2244 pyro damage, even though Jean has 0 EM (Bennett had 141 EM in this run). A subsequent vaporized Surefire pulse at 0:21 dealt 872 damage, which was the expected amount if Jean is the trigger. 

Though there isn't currently a known method for reliably reproducing this phenomenon, it is near certain that the conditions required to replicate this involves swapping characters while under both Bennett Q and Jean Q such that Jean's Q applies anemo right before Bennett's Q applies pyro on the active character. 

**Significance:**  
This is the second known scenario where anemo is not the trigger of a swirl reaction, but rather is the aura of one (the first being the Anemo Hypostasis). For sunfire specifically, this could substantially reduce the damage of a chain reacted sunfire pulse. This also implies that certain sources of anemo can cause a unit other than the Anemo Hypostasis to have a reactable amount of anemo aura

Lastly, it debunks the common belief that anemo cannot be the aura for a swirl reaction (though the behavior of the Anemo Hypostasis already serves as limited proof)

## Constellation Mechanics

### Jean's C4 Verticality

**By:** Special\#1775  
**Added:** 11/24/2020

**Findings:**  
Jean's fourth constellation has the following effect:  
_"Within the Field created by Dandelion Breeze, all opponents have their Anemo RES decreased by 40%."_  
The Anemo Resistance reduction component of this constellation still applies vertically even if her Elemental Burst misses enemies on Venti's Elemental Burst

**Evidence:**  
[https://youtu.be/3deF3geFYdE](https://youtu.be/3deF3geFYdE)

**Significance:**  
The reach of Dandelion Breeze's damage component has a vertical limit but the effects of it can reach much further. Thus, has potential combination for Xiao midair strikes.
