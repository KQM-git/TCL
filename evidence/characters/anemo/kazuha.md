### Normal Attack Mechanics
* Kazuha's normal attacks cannot strike enemies lifted by Venti's Elemental Burst. - [RayXD\#7790](https://imgur.com/a/mHxRQjF)  
* N5 persists after Kazuha cancels his animation or leaves the field. - [GottaGoFast\#7876](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmcma8d4z6o)  
* While under the influence of Chihayaburu, plunge attacks will always deal anemo damage despite infusion. - [GottaGoFast\#7876](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8rDXpz4gTo)  
* NA and CA share ICD. - [xTuki\#4893](https://imgur.com/qsD7hgT)  

### Skill Mechanics
* Tap E particle count is fixed [3 anemo orbs](https://i.imgur.com/KDeL4wp.png). Hold E particle count is fixed [4 anemo orbs](https://i.imgur.com/0oulfFW.png). -  Steph\#3614
  * Chihayaburu will only generate particles when the initial vacuum hits enemies. Video confirmation. - [EdisonsMathsClub\#6469](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdyWE2T66VE)  
* E tap/hold initial cast&plunge can pull Klee's bombs. - [Zozer\#1782](https://youtu.be/O-sjqUAtirA)  
* E can be used mid air to regain stamina while climbing. - [GottaGoFast\#7876](https://youtu.be/hUfGxLDsHTw)  
* E can be used mid air to regain stamina when gliding after starting to fall. - [GottaGoFast\#7876](https://youtu.be/iboABc_eh60)  
* Kazuha's interruption resistance is greatly increased when mid-air. - [Bubba\#4619](https://imgur.com/a/BWEjMxq)  
* Skill can be slightly held for a minimal suction increase while keeping tap E's cooldown. - [helba\#0777](https://imgur.com/a/55baYSz)  
* Kazuha's elemental skill is an incredible tool for gathering loot in the overworld. - [Greyhound\#7836](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ELY1kTC7AI)

### Burst Mechanics
* Kazuha Slash snapshots. - [MysticalMerlin\#5020](https://imgur.com/a/MC9nEnq)
* Kazuha Slash can self-infuse auras. - [HappyGL\#0523](https://imgur.com/a/VfCg2cA)  
* Infusion priority order is [Pyro](https://imgur.com/a/3FsxwG9) > [Hydro > Electro](https://imgur.com/a/3tFexju) > [Cryo](https://imgur.com/a/CJ5feqy).  - HappyGL\#0523  

### Ascension Mechanics  
* Kazuha's 1st ascension passive applies aura before the plunge damage, allowing kazuha to swirl off of no aura on enemies, but also adding the risk of not swirling if the applied aura reacts with an existing aura and removing. - [Vherax\#5321](https://i.imgur.com/7n0rlWE.mp4)  
* Kazuha's 4th ascension passive works off-field and only gives bonus damage on swirled elements. - [kingjohn23\#8694](https://youtu.be/3ryW4jG38y0)  
* Kazuha's 4th ascension passive overrides&refreshes buff each swirl. - [kol\#1593](https://youtu.be/-D8IMtMAt48)  

### Constellation Mechanics  
* C2: Effects stack with Diona's C6. - [jd baby\#6541](https://imgur.com/a/F1qGWD4)  
* C4: The energy gained from C4 while gliding is not affected by energy recharge, it takes 23 ticks to cap after using a burst. - [Jilanow\#9252](https://youtu.be/V0o_-DF0DiA)  
* C4: Kazuha can gain his energy back through gliding before abyss chamber. - [xTuki\#4893](https://imgur.com/EFeCgB2)  
* C6: Kazuha's Anemo Infusion can be overriden by other infusion effects. - [anema\#0006](https://imgur.com/vNyOiFt)  
* C6: The anemo infusion from C6 can react with infusion field triggering a swirl reaction based on the field maker's EM. - [Jilanow\#9252](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YoyUKu-cPY)  
* C6: Damage bonus works regardless of infusion overlap, but only during infusion duration. - [xTuki\#4893](https://imgur.com/eJJc5K6)  
  

## Burst Mechanics

### Kazooka

**Finding:**  
Due to infusion priority mechanics, Kazuha can swirl cryo with his burst while infusing with pyro, which allows him to buff Cryo DMG% and shred cryo resistance while infusing his burst with pyro.  

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
New Ganyu melt team

**Finding:** Rotations to properly swirl&infuse desired elements.  

**Rotations:**

## Calculations/Resources

### EM vs ADC Kazuha

**Finding:**  
EM builds are comparable to damage/crit builds on Kazuha in personal damage output. With Kazuha's EM-based team buff, this makes EM builds stronger overall.  

**Evidence:**  
[Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a6-onb86Aphedf-dL5dq4frc2F3IrivggFuhp53D3vw/edit#gid=146292907)  

**Signifiance:**  
EM is overall the better build choice for Kazuha in almost every situation.

### EM vs ADC Kazuha Team DMG Calculation

**Finding:**  
For Childe/Xiangling reverse vape teams in single-target situations, Kazuha's EM build will outdamage (in terms of team damage) Kazuha's attack build.

**Signifiance:**  
Even with high investment Kazuha (Bennett Buff, Jade Cutter, 25 substats) it is more beneficial to team damage to run an EM/EM/EM build over an ATK/Anemo/Crit build in teams where Kazuha plays a supporting role.
