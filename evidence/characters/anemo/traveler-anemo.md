## Skill Mechanics

### AMC E Additional Elemental Damage

**By:** Neptunya\#8291, phaZ\#6461, and Bobrokrot\#0111  
**Added:** 11/5/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/883277582366277652/906334012480561162/transcript-amc-e-additional-elemental-dmg.html)  

**Finding:**  
Anemo MC's skill is missing talent values for the additional elemental damage that happens when elemental absorption occurs.  
The additional elemental damage dealt is 0.25x that of the anemo damage dealt.  

**Evidence:**  
[Google Doc showing the additional elemental damage dealt](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uTBPUMtR4bQ_T7QeQc6_JRXQvcYxz1muZXiiSEF-Ze8/edit#gid=0)

**Significance:**  
There will always be those who dare to brave Anemo MC's blender of numbers. 

### AMC Hold E Ticks

**Finding:**  
The Additional Elemental DMG on AMC Hold E ticks between 5 and 6 times, while the Skill itself can tick up to 7 times.

**Evidence:**  
[Youtube](https://youtu.be/QC0ZXCX2CeA) - There are 2 attempts in the video, the first one shows 5 ticks and the second one shows 6, but it's never 7.
 
**Significance:**  
The Additional Elemental DMG seems to randomly start with the second Initial Cutting DMG or with the first Max Cutting DMG.

### AMC Snapshot

**Finding:**  
AMC Hold E is dynamic and Q snapshots, for both the Anemo and the Additional Elemental DMG.

**Evidence:**  
* Hold E: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/XbZFc77QXQE)  
Unbuffed Max Cutting DMG (0 stacks, no crit): 171 Anemo, 42 Electro  
Buffed Max Cutting DMG (2 stacks, no crit): 199 Anemo, 49 Electro

* Q: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/lnia3ynnn0Y)  
Tornado DMG (no C6): 824 Anemo, 253 Electro  
Tornado DMG (C6 RES shred): 962 Anemo, 295 Electro

## Burst Mechanics

### Anemo MC's Burst Absorption is 2B

**By:** Kourinn\#6001

**Added:** 13/12/2021

[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/912926771412869150/919900426554454083/transcript-anemo-traveler-q-2b.html)

**Finding:** Anemo MC's Burst is 1U Anemo, but the absorption is 2B.

**Evidence:** 
* With delayed absorption, the last absorption element application matches expected aura duration for 2B absorption with 1U anemo:
  * [2B Absorption](https://youtu.be/yh4dH0WbA6A)
* With 1A type decay transfer and immediate absorption, the last absorption element application matches expected aura duration for 2U absorption: 
  * [2B Absorption with 1A Decay](https://youtu.be/2MtlaOVx904)

**Significance:** The increased absorption gauge may be useful for:
* Shield breaking when able to absorb a counter element.
* Increased freeze duration otherwise unavailable due to the rarity of 2B hydro applicators (only Tartaglia and Kokomi as of patch 2.3)

### Anemo MC's Q ability to "pick up" enemies is dependent on level difference

**By:** Tsym\#2586  
**Added:** 11/22/2020

**Editor's Note:** This same behavior can be observed for Venti. Venti was tested comprehensively by the theorycrafting community; pending submission.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/rBDMuzkVb54 ](https://youtu.be/rBDMuzkVb54%20)

See the video. In the two clips I didn't change anything other than leveling up the character. I also tried putting more attack on her instead when she was level 71 with no effect.

Note that level 71 is sufficient to pick up the enemies on Spiral Abyss floor 11-1, which are level 88, so the level difference requirement might be ~25 or so, since going from 71 to 75 is enough to pick up the level 98 enemies on Floor 12-1.

**Significance:** Anemo MC needs to be of a sufficiently high level relative to the enemy in order to be at all useful in combat at high enough levels.

### AMC Burst AOE
**By:** pai#3602  
**Added:** 1/27/2022  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/932713520880037960/936073712623583232/transcript-amc-burst-aoe.html)

**Finding:**  
The Additional Elemental DMG has less AoE than the Tornado DMG. 

**Evidence:**  
[Youtube](https://youtu.be/JZfWZiAeMsc) - In the video there were all 9 instances of Tornado DMG but only 1 instance of Additional Elemental DMG because the Ruin Guard wasn't right next to the pillar and the Tornado was stuck on the pillar.

**Significance:**  
The Additional Elemental DMG basically only happens when the Tornado goes right through an enemy.

## Ascension Passive Mechanics

### A1: Slitting Wind

#### Anemo Traveler triggers Mistsplitter NA Stack

**By:** amaryillis#4774  
**Added:** 9/6/2021  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/881703224262938685/884467343575633980/transcript-anemo-traveler-mistsplitter-stacks.html)

**Finding:**  
Anemo Traveler can trigger Mistsplitter NA Stack with Slitting Wind.

**Evidence:**  
[Youtube](https://youtu.be/6LpsILZWm9E): Mistsplitter Reforged is seen with zero stacks (no glow) at the beginning, with full burst. After anemo windblade hits, a glow is seen, showing that a stack of Mistsplitter has been produced.

**Significance:**  
AMC can reliably trigger 2 stacks of Mistsplitter Reforged, thereby making them able to utilize it for an anemo damage boost in cases of teams where they are a dps with their E.

#### Anemo Traveler A1 counts as Normal Attack

**By:** Blank#4561  
**Added:** 07/13/2021

**Finding:**  
Anemo Traveler A1 counts as Normal Attack Damage.

**Evidence:**  
Anemo Traveler's A1 Passive Slitting Wind is increased by Normal Attack DMG bonus: https://youtu.be/e6hCib9ZM2Q

**Significance:**  
Although a minor damage source, Anemo Traveler's A1 Passive damage is increased by DMG bonuses towards Normal Attacks.


## Constellation Mechanics

### C6: Intertwined Winds

#### C6 Effect Duration

**By:** Orodalf\#9570  
**Added:** 2/12/2021

**Finding:** Anemo Traveller C6 lasts 10 seconds.

**Evidence:** [https://i.imgur.com/H7zQc6Y](https://imgur.com/H7zQc6Y)

Final hit of Traveller Q at 3 seconds, Venti's Q stops doing extra damage at 13 seconds:

**Significance:** I didn't see this written down anywhere else, so.
