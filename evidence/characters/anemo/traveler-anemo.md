## Burst Mechanics

### Anemo MC's Q ability to "pick up" enemies is dependent on level difference

**By:** Tsym\#2586  
**Added:** 11/22/2020

**Editor's Note:** This same behavior can be observed for Venti. Venti was tested comprehensively by the theorycrafting community; pending submission.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/rBDMuzkVb54 ](https://youtu.be/rBDMuzkVb54%20)

See the video. In the two clips I didn't change anything other than leveling up the character. I also tried putting more attack on her instead when she was level 71 with no effect.

Note that level 71 is sufficient to pick up the enemies on Spiral Abyss floor 11-1, which are level 88, so the level difference requirement might be ~25 or so, since going from 71 to 75 is enough to pick up the level 98 enemies on Floor 12-1.

**Significance:** Anemo MC needs to be of a sufficiently high level relative to the enemy in order to be at all useful in combat at high enough levels.

Final hit of Traveller Q at 3 seconds, Venti's Q stops doing extra damage at 13 seconds:

**Significance:** I didn't see this written down anywhere else, so.
