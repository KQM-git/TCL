## Inspiration Field Buff Duration

**By:** Comfy Seaweed\#3841  
**Added:** 11/22/2020

**Theory:** Bennett's Ult \(ATK buff\) refreshes every tick \(estimate around 1 second\). This means that the ATK buff may persist for awhile after swapping the character out, but will not stay throughout the duration.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/BFjMCysZBng](https://youtu.be/BFjMCysZBng)

Xingqiu's sword damage with no Bennett's Ult: 286 \(no crit\), 900 \(crit\)  
Xingqiu's sword damage with Bennett's Ult: 500\(no crit\), 1576 \(crit\)

We can see in the video that after swapping Xingqiu out, the ATK buff remains for a short while and then expires, even though the active character remains in the AOE. Swapping back to Xingqiu gives him the buff again.

This means that the ATK buff does not persist throughout the duration of Bennett's Ult, but instead refreshes.

**Significance:**

Although probably not too significant, you may want to use Bennett's Ult before Xingqiu's Ult, so that the first \(or first two\) wave of swords have the ATK buff from Bennett.

## **Knockback Protection Interaction**

**By:** sacstanxiang\#7439 and Novaa\#1006  
**Added:** 12/1/2020

**Theory:** Active shields and Xingqiu’s Orbital Swords prevent Bennett Charged E knockback.

**Evidence:**

Prevent knockback and maximise DPS

## Bennett Hold E Counts as Self Damage

**Finding:** Despite Bennett's level 2 e being damageless, when under the effects of xingqiu's sword shields, holding e for the full duration bursts a sword.

**Evidence:** [Video](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844058207151325224/844058535716192316/SVID_20210518_111047_1.mp4)

**Significance:** Dont hold E for its full duration under Xingqiu's rainsword, or you'll lose a rainsword instance.

## Gauge Units of C6 Infusion

**By:** Sayline\#5959

**Finding:**  
If C6 is enabled, auto-attacks infused with pyro have 1u worth of pyro application.  
\*1u \(or 1 gauge unit\) is the Keqing Mains theorycrafting standard for elemental auras.  
\*1u is about 9.5 seconds, and 2u is about 12 seconds. 4u auras exist, but only on Beidou.

**Evidence:**

with Zhongli:

**Significance:**

Knowing this allows us to know which units to pair with C6 Bennett in order to reliably proc Vaporize or Melt.

We want to have an elemental trigger that has more GUs than our elemental aura, so the pyro infused auto will always Vaporize/Melt.

## Duration of C6 Infusion

**By:** nekomimi\#3842

**Theory:**  
C6 Bennett pyro infusion time when you step out of it is roughly 2 seconds.

**Evidence:**  
[https://youtu.be/cj3qkWH-KuA](https://youtu.be/cj3qkWH-KuA)

**Significance:**  
Stepping out of a C6 Bennett Fantastic Voyage field has a left over pyro infusion effect of roughly 2 seconds. Meaning that even if you are outside of it, you have that window to chase after an enemy and still have your weapon infused.

## Noblesse Oblige \(2\) Interaction

**By:** Cenpi\#3224

**Theory:** Can 2pc Noblesse Oblige Boost the Party ATK Buff from Bennett Q

**Finding:**

2 Set Noblesse Oblige \(+20% Elemental Burst DMG\) does not affect the amount of ATK received from Bennett burst. Please watch the 2 linked videos.

Evidence

[Video 1](https://youtu.be/FtMGPG7aqU0): No artifacts

[Video 2](https://youtu.be/eyGNEO1Pe-E): 2 NO

## Bennett Q and C6 Buff Self Application

**Bennett Q buff and C6 Pyro DMG Bonus applies on its own damage calculation**

**By:** Zeitraffer\#1074 and Charliex3000\#9403  
**Added:** 2/19/2021

**Theory:**  
Bennett’s Q Buff and C6 Pyro DMG Bonus should apply on its own damage calculation.

**Evidence:**  
Using a damage calculator, we estimate the damage dealt by Bennett's Q if the Q buff and Pyro DMG bonus from C6 is applied. We see that the value estimated is within the permissible error margins of this test and proves that his buffs do apply.

**Significance:**  
For Bennett Main DPS, Bennett himself will buff his own Q.

## Bennett Burst Coop Mechanics

**By:** Crow \| WL8 \#1761  
**Added:** 4/15/2021

**Finding:** Bennett's attack buff prioritizes the burst that applied the attack buff first. This means that even when two Bennett bursts overlap, the attack buff that was applied first will remain.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/ooYtsZhYUxc](https://youtu.be/ooYtsZhYUxc)

**Significance:** In the case of coop with multiple Bennetts, be sure to time your bursts so that the Bennett that applies the highest attack buff places their field first.

**Finding:**  
Bennett's attack buff lingers for a bit after the visual of the circle fades away.

**Evidence:**

* [Clip 1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844783206262636545/844784370476646440/video0.mov): The Burst visual has disappeared, Xingqiu runs over and he still has Pyro status applied to himself. DMG is 32k
* For reference, [Clip 2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844783206262636545/844784610411151390/video0.mov) has Xingqiu in the same setting without Bennett buff, who deals 20k in this instance

**Significance:**  
Better understanding of Bennett Burst mechanics
