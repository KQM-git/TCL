## Guoba CDR Interaction

**By:** miliana\#9407  
**Added:** 04/18/2021

Credit to Risuke\#6743 for suggesting the idea.

**Finding:** 4TF Xiangling and C2 Chongyun can result in 2 Guobas being deployed at the same time.

**Evidence:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDHZhkOwGk8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDHZhkOwGk8)

**Significance:** It's possible to get 100%+ guoba uptime on Xiangling using 4TF. This also shows that there is nothing in the game preventing multiple Goubas from being summoned. This is unlikely to ever be optimal, but that wasn't the point of testing this.

## Xiangling Burst Movement Interaction

**By:** ganjo\#1859  
**Added:** 04/19/2021

**Finding:** The hitbox of Xiangling's ultimate can hit more than once per rotation by manipulating self and enemy positioning.

**Evidence:**

[12 ult hits when standing still against ruin guard \(no hitbox extensions\)](https://youtu.be/CV01mRP-oZA)

[15+ ult hits when enemy extends their hitboxes and some small movement](https://youtu.be/sBW6qrqfs_E?t=10)

[15+ ult hits when using charged attacks to displace ult](https://youtu.be/PWpTYNlnIic?t=10)

[Dashing through with ultimate changes clockwise rotation to anti-clockwise on some hits \(first hit notably in below video\)](https://youtu.be/oILW9mK8neQ)

**Significance:** It is possible to significantly boost the total damage of Xiangling's ultimate \(&gt;25%\) by moving in specific patterns and utilizing enemy hitboxes to get more hits in per ult.

**Finding:**  
Xiangling's pyronado applies only 1U to Cryo Regisvine's shield over it's duration.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
Don't rely on pyronado alone to destroy Cryo Regisvine's shield

**Finding:**  
With both Hu Tao and Xiangling in the same team utilizing Xingqiu to reverse vaporize their attacks, Xiangling will trigger reverse vaporize on 60% of her pyronado hits, while Hu Tao will trigger reverse vaporize on 23.5% of her N1 attacks, 49% of her charged attacks, and 59% of her Blood Blossom Hits.

**Significance:**  
Can be used to calculate Hu Tao/Xiangling dual pyro teams and their efficacy compared to other teams.

## Guoba Self Applies Pyro

**Theory:**  
In line with previous evidence that was non-conclusive, it appears that Guoba actually does apply Pyro to himself whenever he attacks.  If you time an AoE Anemo ability with his flame attack, it will cause a Pyro Swirl off of Guoba.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
More information about how Guoba mechanics work, and a more precise explanation of why Guoba can cause Pyro Absorption in Anemo Bursts.

**Theory:**  
Xiangling’s C2 damage instance has no ability type scaling tags. 

**Evidence:**

## XL pyronado does not benefit from her c6

**Theory:**  
Pyronado does not benefit from XL C6.  
The 3rd hit of the initial swings & Guoba, however, does benefit from her C6.

**Evidence:**  
Using iwintolose's damage calculator, Pyronado ticks were expected to do 248 damage to a level 85 Ruin Guard after C6 buffs are applied (unbuffed Pyronado ticks are at 228).  
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/Dvo4D9T) (some rounding errors, but should be close enough)  
Looking at in-game numbers however, we see that Pyronado ticks deal the same amount of damage even after C6 buffs are applied.

**Significance:**  
Guoba > Pyronado
