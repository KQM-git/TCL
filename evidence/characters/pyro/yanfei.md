## Basic Mechanics

* Stamina consumption decrease from seals affects all actions - [Aluminum\#5462](https://youtu.be/0EqhvYyKA64)
* Yanfei's E has 1A pyro application - [Ayzel\#7399](https://tcl-backup.s3.filebase.com/evidence/characters/pyro/yanfei.md/discord/attachments_835739595387699200_836803250611159070_yanfei_E_gauge.mp4)
* Yanfei's Q has 2B pyro application - [xf3\#3123](https://tcl-backup.s3.filebase.com/evidence/characters/pyro/yanfei.md/discord/attachments_835739595387699200_836865777721933824_2021-04-28_03-24-33_Trim.mp4)
* Yanfei's [Charged Attack](https://tcl-backup.s3.filebase.com/evidence/characters/pyro/yanfei.md/discord/attachments_835739595387699200_836802384726196224_yanfei_shatters_on_charge.mp4) and [Elemental Skill](https://tcl-backup.s3.filebase.com/evidence/characters/pyro/yanfei.md/discord/attachments_835739595387699200_836802677403811850_yanfei_shatters_on_E.mp4) shatter - Ayzel\#7399
* Yanfei's A4 is on a separate ICD from her charged attack. - [Sitri\#9504](https://imgur.com/a/0hlcbRa)
* Yanfei's A4 applies 1A pyro and has no noticeable ICD to trigger or apply pryo. - [Aetherpon\#5730](https://tcl-backup.s3.filebase.com/evidence/characters/pyro/yanfei.md/discord/attachments_835739595387699200_836814060074172416_YanfeiA4ApplyPyro.mp4)
* Yanfei's E generates 3 particles - [Steph\#3614 and Neptunya\#8291](https://youtu.be/_-hD5iHi594)
* Yanfei's A1 applies the pyro bonus before charged attack damage is calculated. - [Bobrokrot\#0111](https://tcl-backup.s3.filebase.com/evidence/characters/pyro/yanfei.md/discord/attachments_835739595387699200_836874610191499264_2021-04-28_10-50-56.mp4)

## Constellation Mechanics

### C6: Extra Clause

#### C6 Yanfei Stamina Consumed Reduction

**Finding:**  
Yanfei's Charged Attack Stamina consumption is reduced by 15% per seal. Yanfei's C1 makes each of her seal reduce Stamina cost of her Charged Attacks by and additional 10%. Her C6 allows her to have an extra 1 seal for a max of 4. 4 seals, each giving 25% Stamina reduction each results in her Charged Attacks not costing stamina. Video proof attached, first Charged Attack with 0 seals consumes Stamina and causes bar to appear, second Charged Attack with full seals after gaining them through Yanfei's E does not.

**Evidence:** [Video](https://youtu.be/S3SkDNAuwzc)

**Significance:**  
With a play style heavily centered around charge attacks, Yanfei's C6 allowing her to have 0 Stamina cost per Charged Attack makes her C6 very useful.
