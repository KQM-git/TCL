# Klee

## How does 2 set Noblesse Oblige interact with C1 Klee?

**By:** fin\#1623  
**Added:** 12/6/2020

**Theory:**

Does Noblesse affect Klee's c1 procs.

**Finding:**

Yes they do.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**

2NO + 2 witch might be a viable set for an at least c1 klee and makes animation cancelling more worth it as it triggers \(klee’s c1\) by AAing and skills.

**Finding:**

Klee's burst \(Q\) is snapshotted.

**Significance:**

You can leave bennett Q after using klee burst and you also keep other atk% buffs that were enabled before klee burst.

## Klee mine ICD

**By:** Sakuno\#7950 and Steph\#3614  
**Added:** 03/16/2021

**Theory:** This is an independent verification of @Steph's findings, that Klee's mines that normally have separate ICD's have trouble applying their pyro application \(for the purpose of breaking elemental shields\) if they detonate on an enemy too quickly i.e. on the same frame.

**Evidence/Method:** I detonated all 8 of Klee's mines into a hydro abyss mage using Anemo MC's burst. Then I measured how many U's worth of shield was damaged by counting pixels. Note it takes 24U of pyro to completely break a hydro abyss mage's shield.

1st Attempt: [https://i.imgur.com/mUlLZhI.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/mUlLZhI.jpeg) note: the anemo also damages the shield. I will make note if it did this. Here it didn't. Frame 1 is always one frame before the first bomb reaches & deals dmg to the abyss mage. on Frame 5 it dealt 2U's worth of pyro damage. Total only 5U of shield damage.

2nd Attempt: [https://i.imgur.com/GmHWMON.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/GmHWMON.jpg) 1U of dmg on frame 2, 2U's worth on frame 4 and 6. Totalling 5U from bombs.

3rd Attempt: [https://i.imgur.com/AYXWLT7.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/AYXWLT7.jpg) Anemo dealt 1U before the bombs reached. 1U on frame 2. 2U on frame 4. 1U on frame 8. Totalling only 4U from bombs.

**Conclusion:** If too many mines hit the mage in too short a span you waste the mines' ICDs. Also I could not observe a larger hit to the abyss mage's shield than 2U in one frame.

**Significance:\*** Only a maximum of 2U worth of shield dmg possible in one frame? \(inconclusive\)

Klee can break hydro abyss shields faster by abusing the fact that her mines are on separate ICD's so long as you have a way to gather them. However anemo MC's burst is not the best way for this because the bombs detonate on the mage at the same time, wasting U's. \(you waste 3 to 4 mines worth of dmg\). You are better off holding E as steph suggests. Same with Jean don't tap E, hold E so that the mines gather onto the mage \(also credit Steph\).

## Failure to proc Klee's talent 'Pounding Surprise' \(Explosive Spark\), if she is swapped out immediately after attacking.

**Theory:** Klee's talent 'Pounding Surprise' doesn't proc the 50% chance to spawn the 'Explosive Spark' if she's swapped off-field after auto attacking or using her E.

**Evidence:** Tested for a few minutes on a world boss, but here's just a short clip. [https://youtu.be/0DEbRVl1pXE](https://youtu.be/0DEbRVl1pXE) [https://youtu.be/SGMMKs5lpkI](https://youtu.be/SGMMKs5lpkI) [https://youtu.be/sTtaWS0g1gQ](https://youtu.be/sTtaWS0g1gQ)

**Significance:** Should the reverse be true, two grounded walk-cancel AA1s from Klee would allow you to switch characters immediately after the second without any downside. However, as it stands, players looking to maximize the benefit from the talent's charge attack buff will want to look for the proc before swapping, bringing two grounded AA1s closer in-line to - AA1 &gt; AA2 &gt; jump cancel combo. As for why you would want to swap characters frequently from Klee in the first place, that would be to set up reactions manually, or refresh Viridescent Venerer 4pc effect. A rotation could run something like this:

* Klee AAs until Explosive Spark proc
* Sucrose Swirl
* Swap to Cryo/Hydro unit and wait briefly for pyro to elapse naturally due to the swirl shortening its duration before proccing the aura element
* Klee Charge Attack
* Repeat.

## Turbo Klee with C6 Fischl

**By:** Vye\#9195  
**Added:** 4/2/2021

**Finding:**

Klee is able to provide a sufficient enough pyro aura to overtake Oz for a Fischl pyro turbo setup.

Setup is as follows:

* Klee is equipped with a 4 piece thundering fury to determine if she or Oz are triggering overload
* We start on Fischl calling Oz, then switch to Klee for pyro aura.
* Klee's combo is EQ followed by 1NACA jump cancel spam or 2NACA jump cancel spam
* After one initial thundering fury trigger Klee overtakes Oz in aura and therefore the turbo mechanic starts working

**Significance:**

Klee can potentially be used as the main pyro unit enabling Fisch turbo comps. However this requires a high barrier of execution due to Klees mechanical nature.
