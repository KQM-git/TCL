## Skill Mechanics

### Baron Bunny's aura

**Finding:**  
Baron Bunny is allowed to have a hydro or cryo aura, as well as be frozen. In the former case only environmental effects may apply the hydro aura. Most reactions function properly on this aura, notable crystalize, swirl, superconduct and shatter. It is not known how one may apply a pyro or electro aura to the Bunny, and the author could not find a way for the bunny to be electrocharged.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
Baron Bunny may be used as an entity to hold certain auras.

### Amber E Duration Begins When Bunny Lands

**Finding:**  
Amber Elemental Skill duration starts when Baron Bunny lands and unfurls itself.  

**Evidence:**  
In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ7-hV7b0Mc), Amber's Skill cooldown begins upon pressing E, Baron Bunny does not land until the cooldown says \~12.5 seconds, which is when the duration for the Skill begins. Baron Bunny then lasts for 8 seconds, exploding when the cooldown says \~4.5 seconds.  

**Significance:**  
Mostly fluff and something inconsequential, no real purpose where it's necessary yet.  

## Burst Mechanics

### Amber Ult Targeting

**Finding:** Amber's Q likely does not land randomly in certain pre-determined areas.  
It is suspected that any enemies standing in the outer zone of Amber's Q are hit a random number of times (not fixed).

The exact mechanic is guessed to be as follows:

* 8 arrows with damage radius of 2.6 will fall randomly along a circle 2.6 units away from the center of the Q
* 10 arrows with damage radius of 2.6 will fall randomly in a circular area between 0 to 2.6 units away from the center of the Q

As such, anything outside of 2.6 units from the center (so approx. half way) is expected to get hit a random number of times, with closer to the edge being lower in the number of hits

**Evidence:** 

* [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9PTktXgK_B9Rb_4JWwXgQ-EBeR26QFpe)
* [Spreadsheet Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18JB0rZ8TA4nFt-vpwcmFbNFitqpM2XyLgo7WGGvrNmE/edit#gid=0)
* [G-Drive with full clips](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z9HYWda7DiBQngmjjxRronPbccrdkybe?usp=sharing)

Specifically in the f1 video:
* The slime at the very edge is barely touching amber's Q, and is hit 6 times. The outer edge AoE system as described by the theory hunt can be thought of as circle AoEs entirely enclosed within the circle of Amber's Q, and fixed to center exactly 2.6 units away from the middle of Amber's Q, as Amber's Q was described to have a radius of approximately 2.6 x 2, and each of her outer-edge AoEs land in a circle of 2.6 radius from the center of her Q.  
* The odds of this slime being hit randomly by entirely enclosed AoEs within Amber's ult 6 times out of 18, especially considering that 10 of the arrows have the entire inner circle of 2.6 to land in that would miss this outer slime, is close to 0.  

There is another example of this happening in 4c, when one of the slimes jumps in halfway through ambers ult, and with barely any of its hitbox entering her AoE, is struck 3 times.  

### Amber Burst Overload Consistency

**Finding/Bug:** Amber ult with full EM gear vs Electro Hypostasis can sometimes deal 3 large chunks of damage due to Overload reaction and sometimes 4.

**Evidence:**

* Amber 3 overloads: [https://youtu.be/e1YCTAdjJ2A](https://youtu.be/e1YCTAdjJ2A)
* Amber 4 overloads: [https://youtu.be/vXttP0fBsM0](https://youtu.be/vXttP0fBsM0)

**Significance:** The random arrow distribution in Amber's burst makes the reaction potential of her burst as the trigger very inconsistent.

## Constellation Mechanics

### C0: 2 Simultaneous Baron Bunnies

**By:** Exuma\#1917

**Finding:**  
Two Baron Bunnies can exist simultaneously on C0 Amber.

**Evidence:** [Video](https://youtu.be/a3_6u2jdFsE)  
Test was done on Floor 1 of the Abyss with a 4-piece Gambler set. 

**Significance:**  
It is possible to spawn multiple Baron Bunnies at once without C4 Amber. 

### Amber C1 & C2 Damage

**Finding/Bug:**  
* Amber’s C1 damage instance is considered CA damage.  
* Amber’s C2 damage instance is considered skill damage.

**Evidence:**  
Testing done by Peekays\#2722 and minah\#0853  
Damage increases with 4WT bonus - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKHwO8wz0U) and [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPVvaP6QUV4)  

Testing done by minah\#0853  
Damage increases with 2gambler bonus, and does not increase when 4NO buff is activated after skill cast but before detonation - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKHwO8wz0U)

**Significance:** Damage calculations and rotation considerations for Amber

## C2: Bunny Triggered

### Amber C2 Works on CO-OP Teammate Baron Bunnies

**By:** flibby404\#5843  
**Added:** 03/09/2022  
[Discussion](https://tickettool.xyz/direct?url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945097851195777054/951192426075267152/transcript-amber-c2-works-on-coop-teammate-baron-bunnies.html)  

**Finding:**  
C2 Amber users can trigger teammates' baron bunnies. This effect works even if the teammate does not own C2 Amber, but the damage bonus will not apply without it.  

**Evidence:**  
[Video 1](https://youtu.be/dNJIaT1MP8w)  
* The damage bonus does not apply if the teammate does not own C2 Amber.  

[Video 2](https://youtu.be/-JPTFQlZ6vk)  
* Mathematical Confirmation:  

    * Hilichurls
        * Automatic Detonation: 102 \(ATK\) \* 123.2% \(Talent Scaling\) \* 1 \(Damage Bonus\) \* 90% \(10% Pyro Resistance\) \* 0.425 \(Rounded Defense Multiplier\) = 48.06648
        * Manual Detonation: 102 \(ATK\) \* 123.2% \(Talent Scaling\) \* 1+2 \* 90% \(10% Pyro Resistance\) \* 0.425 \(Rounded Defense Multiplier\) = 144.19944
    * Regisvine
        * Automatic Detonation: 102 \(ATK\) \* 123.2% \(Talent Scaling\) \* 1 \(Damage Bonus\) \* 90% \(10% Pyro Resistance\) \* 0.404 \(Rounded Defense Multiplier\) = 45.6914304
        * Manual Detonation: 102 \(ATK\) \* 123.2% \(Talent Scaling\) \* 1 \(Damage Bonus\) \* 90% \(10% Pyro Resistance\) \* 0.404 \(Rounded Defense Multiplier\) = 137.0742912

A crit on the automatic detonation at 50% crit damage would land 72 on the hilichurls and 69 on the regisvine, rather than 144 and 137 respectively.  

**Significance:**  
 Optimizing niche coop damage scenarios and possible applications on future characters with similar effects.
