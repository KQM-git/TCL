## Skill Mechanics

### Kaeya E Energy Trials

**Finding:** Kaeya generates particles between 2-3 \(4-5 if accounting for ascension talent\) at a 1:2 ratio, not a 1:1 ratio.

**Evidence:** [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B9PoD7YlKWPoXBpsIc2fARw9zSml-gWQtSoNd3fr7z8/edit?usp=sharing)

**Methodology:** I used Kaeya's skill 59 times and averaged the number of particles dropped per skill usage, which averaged out to 2.677.

**Significance:** Kaeya gens more energy than in TCL, which probably changes ER requirements for quite a lot of teams \(including Eula\).

## Ascension Mechanics

### A4: Glacial Heart

#### Kaeya A4 procs on frozen targets

**By:** JonahFarc\#7056

**Findings:** Kaeya's A4 is phrased as "Opponents Frozen by **Frostgnaw** will drop additional Elemental Particles." However, enemies don't actually have to be frozen by his elemental skill \_\*\*\_for the additional particles to be generated; as long as Kaeya's skill hits a frozen enemy, it will generate additional elemental particles.

**Evidence:** [Barbara freezes target and Kaeya uses his E afterwards. 4 particles are received, which can only come from his A4 passive.](https://youtu.be/RiTTnpQ44DA)

**Significance:** With freeze comps, you can basically just E whenever you want and still get the additional particles without having to make sure Kaeya's the trigger
