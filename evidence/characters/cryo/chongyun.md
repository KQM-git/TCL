## **3 Attack Rotation Time and Frames + Max Amounts of Shattered Procs with Chongyun Alone \(E is not shattered\)**

By: shdwbld\#8103

**Findings:**

3 Attack Rotations  
3 Full Damage Rotation takes 11.2 Seconds in Cryo-Field with 8% Attack Speed \(buffed\). The duration of Cryo-Field is 10 seconds but charged attack is still infused due to a lingering effect.

**Rough frames and Seconds**

* Frames: 194 \(1 rotation\)
* Seconds: 3.07 \(1 rotation\)

**3 Attack Rotation's Shattered procs with E freezing enemy.**

* \(E Cast\)Apply Cryo \(freeze\)
* 1st. Shattered + Apply cryo \(freeze\)
* 2nd. Shattered + ICD
* 3rd. ICD
* 4th. Apply cryo \(freeze\)
* 5th. Shattered + ICD
* 6nd. ICD
* 7th. Apply cryo \(freeze\)
* 8th. Shattered + ICD
* 9th. ICD
* 10th. Apply cryo \(freeze\)
* 11th. Shattered + ICD
* 12th. ICD

**Conclusion:** From 12 basic attacks

5 shattered - \( E shattered\) Since initial slam to the ground of E has it's own ICD, you can have 2 shattered reactions on the 1st rotation. This will just make it so that you get 1 more reaction and by the end of the 3 rotations, end with a shattered reaction instead of an ICD.

## **Chongyun C6 DMG bonus is Additive**

By: _\*\*_Artesians\#0002

**Findings:**

C6 Chongyun’s “Spirit Blade - Cloud-parting Star deals 15% more DMG to enemies with a lower percentage of their Max HP” is an additive bonus.

**Evidence:**

* Video with the enemy not having a lower percentage of his Max HP than Chongyun:

\(1+0.15+0.223\)/\(1+0.223\) = 320/285 math by **Robin**  
Testing was done with a Lv. 70 Chongyun & 22.3% Cryo DMG Goblet.

**Significance:**

**+15% to Cryo Damage** + Noblesse - the bonus gained from constellation 6 is about ~7% \(ballpark estimate by Kleeful\) for a well built Chongyun. DMG bonus being additive implies that it would deal less damage than previously expected, where it was assumed to be a multiplicative bonus.
