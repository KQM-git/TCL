### Construct Defensive Scaling

**By:** Greyhound\#7836 and Aevean Leeow\#1362  
**Added:** 4/11/2021

**Finding:** Confirming construct defensive stats\(HP/DEF/DR/RES\); All stats are taken at a 1:1 ratio \(except skills that state otherwise in description\) and snapshot on cast.

The constructs tested:

* Geo MC E
* Zhongli E
* Ningguang E
* Albedo E
* Ganyu E
* Amber E

Geo MC Q is unbreakable by anything in the game, it may be potentially coded at an unreachable value for enemy attacks\).

**Evidence:** [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n1ZqZ5FK62NQTc2ETqdojLCnPyoVVPyAxvOT4X-xZ2Q/edit#gid=0)

Video links and Geo MC/Zhongli/Albedo invisible number math fully compiled into the doc.

**Significance:** Better understanding of constructs and their scaling.
