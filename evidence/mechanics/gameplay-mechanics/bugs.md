## Using the Same Team for Both Abyss Halves

By: Nitley\#3485

**Bug/Exploit:** You're able to use your overworld team \(regardless of character overlap with first half team\) for the second half of Spiral Abyss by selecting retry at the same time as killing the last mob.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/XW\_TDsyFkPA](https://youtu.be/XW_TDsyFkPA)

**Significance:** After you clear the second half it doesn't complete, it's unsure whether it would be possible to trick it to complete somehow. It could be useful for speedrun showcases or character highlights in abyss.

## Elemental Skills and Bursts Do Not Reset When using Retry in Abyss

**Bug:** Elemental Skills' and Bursts' CDs do not get reset upon retrying an Abyss floor

**Evidence:** [Youtube](https://youtu.be/3_QlBz5P5B8)

In the first 5 seconds of the clip, I start the Abyss floor and immediately switch to Xingqiu, a character with long CDs, in order to activate vaporize with Diluc. Xingqiu is equipped with an R1 Sacrificial Sword. In order to achieve the "perfect run", I restart the floor to try to activate Sacrificial Sword's passive. Upon restarting the floor, both Xingqiu's E and Q are off cooldown, causing me to restart the floor again.

**Significance:** 

This is significant as some people rely on pure RNG when trying to get that "perfect run". For example, using Xingqiu's Q and following up with two E's \(when using Sacrificial Sword\) to generate as much energy recharge as possible for the next Q is often used in vape comps. When attempting the "perfect run", people may restart several times in the first few seconds of starting a floor to get the Sacrificial Sword's passive to activate. However, they will notice that Xingqiu's E has a 21 second CD which does not get reset upon retrying a stage, forcing them to retry the floor AGAIN. This is especially noticeable on characters with long CDs on elemental skills or bursts.

## Particles Move While Game is Paused

**Finding:** Energy Particles don't stop moving even when you open a pause menu. You can absorb particles while in a pause menu. Works in every menu most notably adventure book and wish menu allowing it to be used in abyss.

**Significance:** Allows characters to quickly absorb particles, reducing the time they are on-screen doing nothing, also reducing the chance they get hit.

**Bug:** Unlimited respawning bushes when using Hu Tao infused with Pyro sets them on fire and then they respawn.

**Significance:** Time to farm your eggs and lizards guys

## Xiangling's Burst can Stack in Contending Tides Event

By: Ayzel\#7399  
Added: 04/09/2021

**Bug:** Xiangling's burst can stack in the Contending Tides event.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/xlburststack.png)

**Significance:** Very fast clears on contending tides, and potentially similar events in the future. This can also be abused in overworld, as Contending Tides is only required for the set up, not the execution.

**Evidence:**

* [Example with Setup](https://youtu.be/OVFeSfE8pSQ)
* [Rip Cryo Regisvine](https://youtu.be/V9_AoUDVKaY)

**Process:**

1. **I**n the contending tides event, cast Xiangling's burst.
2. After casting Xiangling's burst, immediately press M to enter the map, and then press P to abandon challenge.
3. Teleport to a statue of the seven, wait a couple seconds, and then teleport back to the contending tides arena.
4. Start a contending tides challenge, and any stacked bursts will appear. If you're on the first cycle, only one pyronado will appear.
5. Quickly charge Xiangling's burst \(I used 4 pyro characters + around 250% ER to do this\) and cast Xiangling's burst.
6. After casting Xiangling's burst, press M to enter map and press P to abandon challenge.
7. Repeat until you have many bursts stacked.

**Additional Notes:**

* This causes Xiangling's burst to last for a REALLY long time \(about 45-ish seconds\)
* These stacks can be maintained in the open world, so if you want to do something like kill the cryo regisvine in 4 seconds you can do that
* You have to press M and then P in quick succession, because you can't abandon challenge in the map so you have to buffer it by pushing M and then P quickly[ ](https://youtu.be/V9_AoUDVKaY)
