# Weapon Infusion

## Elemental Infusion Priority

**Finding:** Weapon Infusion follows an order based on elements.

**Evidence:** [https://youtu.be/rJKYkrvlnxg](https://youtu.be/rJKYkrvlnxg)

In the video, Chongyun's infusion is overridden by Bennett's infusion. Then Diluc's infusion initially overridden by Chongyun, but then returns to Pyro. Keqing's infusion is overridden by both Chongyun and Bennett.

The order in elemental infusion priority is Pyro &gt; Cryo &gt; Electro. This can be seen with Keqing as when she steps into both Chongyun and Bennett's infusion zones, an Electro elemental reaction occurs, removing her Electro. With Diluc's case, his Dawn infusion can be overridden, which is why in the video he has Cyro for one normal until it returns to Pyro.

Hu Tao, Noelle, Xiao, and Childe cannot have their infusions overridden, as stated in their talent descriptions. As a result, Geo, Anemo, and Hydro cannot be tested yet. Note: Childe is considered as a bow user and as a result, cannot have an infusion.

**Significance:** This can help players that are building their team around characters with infusions. For example, running Chongyun on Keqing makes her unable to use her Electro infusion while Chongyun's Skill is deployed. As more characters that get infusions are released, the weapon infusion order will be more important.
