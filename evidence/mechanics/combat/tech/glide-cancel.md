**Theory/Finding:**  
While in a wind current (such as Venti hold skill), you can jump, glide, and land instantly.  
This is done by jumping, then pressing jump again exactly 4 frames later at 60 fps, or 2 frames later at 30 fps (not sure but I tried counting how many frames the jump took).  
Has worked with every character I've tried so far, but there may be examples where this doesn't work.

**Evidence:**  
I found this technique through this video: [Bilibili Video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Cb4y1d7Kr?from=search&seid=9267604745435991278)

In the few english comments I could find about this, people often said you had to do it by canceling CA, or canceling the glide with N1, or it's just a keqing tech.  
In reality, I think this can be done at any point with anyone as long as you can jump (while on flat ground).

Somewhat doable at 30fps, insanely difficult at 60fps (though not humanly impossible!).

**Significance:**  
Could be used in teams with Venti to do extremely fast cancels without using stamina. Possibly consistent at 30 fps, but usability at 60fps is very questionable.
