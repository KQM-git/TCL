**Finding:**  
Diluc's elemental burst follows a 5-hit rule on elemental application rather than the standard 3-hit rule.

**Evidence:**

**Significance:**  
The vape damage potential of Diluc's burst is lower than one might expect based on the usual 3-hit rule of elemental application. In the above clip, the last hit with higher MV would have also vaped if the 3-hit rule were followed, but instead, only the 1st and 6th hit were vaped. On the other hand, due to the nature of Diluc's burst and how it often does not get its maximum hits anyway, the silver lining is that the longer ICD makes it less likely to result in an unwanted pyro aura.
