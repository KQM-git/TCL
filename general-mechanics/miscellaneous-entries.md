# Miscellaneous Entries

* Characters than can pull/suck items with their abilities (i.e Jean E, Venti Q), all have a limit. This limit can be affected by in-game fps, depending on the specific ability. For more information visit [our evidence page.](./../evidence/general-mechanics/miscellaneous-entries.md#item-suck-limits)
* You can juggle fruits that are freshly harvested from trees. Unfortunately, once they have been on the ground for a certain amount of time, nothing will affect it anymore.
* At least two of the birds (one near Azhdaha and one in Guyun) die very often of drowning, usually before the player even sees them, though their death is also occasionally observed, and they may even sometimes survive. 
  * You can use this to get free fowl. 
* Without using any elemental skills/bursts, the glider, or characters/weapons not freely available to every account, is it possible to climb to the peak of the fully grown Frostbearing Tree? The answer is yes.
* The Kamuijima Cannons in Inazuma can cause friendly damage to yourself, as well as other players in Co-op.
* Average party level warning/zone level/enemy level color warning is a lie, only highest level character is accounted for. 
* Every character model is capable of rolling in place.  
  * In order to perform it, you need enough movement speed and then proceed to jump from being idle -> hold W while falling.
  * Depending on character model, you need up to the following movement speed in order to roll. These are upper bounds and it might be possible to roll with lower values but way harder to execute.
    * Child female - 10%
    * Adult female - 10%
    * Adult male - 25%
    * Teen male - 35%
    * Teen female - 35%
* The Traveler has more than 0 friendship points but less than 10 and does not accumulate.  
* The daily cap for being able to receive drops is 400 elites and 2000 common mobs.  
* The maximum amount of damage that a character can take when doing a Plunge Attack is 40% of their max HP.  

## Cancelling

* For some characters, if they use an elemental skill and sit in a chair at the same time (pressing F and E at the same time for PC users), while the skill will not activate (and as such the skill cooldown will not start), the game will still "treat" the skill as if it had activated, which causes effects like Crimson Witch 4-piece to stack.
  * This can also be performed by interacting with an NPC or a poster instead of a chair.
* Aiming with the Harpastum Ball gadget allow character to quickly cancel their animation in combat. This cancel is slightly faster than jump/dash cancels. However, this doesn't work for charge attacks.
* Kamera Gadget can cancel knockback.
  * Both the Kamera gadget as well as the Special Kamera gadget can be used to "cancel" knockback (instead of flying through the air, the character slides backwards). It can also be used to cancel a dash off of a ledge or the bounce of Bennetts charge level 2 (which seems to behave identical to receiving knockback).
  * To do this, you have to take a picture at the moment where you get hit/leap off a ledge. The method used is to take photos in rapid succession, by pressing "esc" and "y" quickly after one another. This makes timing the photo easier.

## Tanking

* In patch 1.2, Razor and Beidou are the two of the best choices for tanking Electro DMG from an enemy of ANY level, without damage reduction like the reduction provided by Xingqiu's Elemental Skill, with unlimited resources. However, Hu Tao beats them both.
* To tank one hit from an enemy of ∞ level in overworld, without damage reduction eg XQ, certain comps/etc will excel for each damage type.

## Animals Interaction

* Sacrificial Weapons' passives and the 4pc Gambler effect can trigger on Wildlife that drop items (birds and beasts), but does not trigger on Wildlife that act as an interactable item pick-up (material sources).

## Photo Mode

* If you switch from character A to character B in a high-ping environment, then immediately enter Photo Mode, you can use expressions from character A on character B.

## Narukami Shrine Fortune Slip Probabilities  

* There are 16 possible fortune slip results, each with a unique lucky item. The probability of each fortune slip result (and therefore each lucky item) is equal. However, some fortune slips share the same fortune type. The likelihood of each fortune type is the following:  
    * Great Misfortune = 1/16 = 6.25%
    * Misfortune = 2/16 = 12.5%
    * Rising Fortune = 2/16 = 12.5%
    * Modest Fortune = 4/16 = 25%
    * Good Fortune = 3/16 = 18.75%
    * Great Fortune = 4/16 = 25%

## A Study In Potions

The retry button in the event is a full team reset. All cooldowns including weapon passive cooldowns, elemental skills, burst skills and character constellations are fully reset as well as HP and energy.

## Portable Waypoint Bug  
* When placing the Portable Waypoint in certain places such as The Crux and teleporting from a location with an abnormal weather effect, it will be transferred to where the Portable Waypoint is.  

## Hidden wall clip spot in Liyue Merchant Stall
* In Liyue Harbour there's a hidden location behind a stall that allows characters to clip through the walls and infinitely plunge.
