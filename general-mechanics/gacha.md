## Featured Character Banner

Before 74 Pulls \(Soft Pity\), the following chart details the probabilities of obtaining units/characters

| Item | Probability | Pity Guarantee |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5\* | 0.6% | 90 pulls |
| 4\* | 5.1% | 10 pulls |
| 3\* | 94.3% | N/A |

After the soft pity, the probability of the 5\* increases by the base rate \* 10, making it significantly more probable to receive a 5\*.

The featured characters also have increased rates of pulling. The next 5\* is guaranteed to be the featured character if you roll a 5\* that is not featured. Similarly, for the 4\* characters, a featured 4\* is guaranteed if a 4\* is rolled that is not featured.

Thus, the rates before pity weighting are as follows:

| Item | Probability |
| :--- | :--- |
| Featured 5\* | 0.3% |
| Arbitrary 5\* | 0.3% |
| Featured 4\* | 2.55% |
| Arbitrary 4\* | 2.55% |
| Arbitrary 3\* | 94.3% |
| Specific 3\* | 7.25% |

Estimated number of 5\* pulls to get desired character:

| Item | Pulls |
| :--- | :--- |
| C0 character \(with pity\) | 1 |
| C0 character \(no pity\) | 1.5 |
| C6 character \(starting with pity\) | 10 |
| C6 character \(not starting with pity\) | 10.5 |

Number of pulls needed to get different results seperated by the 50th, 95th and 99th Precentile:  

| Item | 50th Percentile | 95th Percentile | 99th Percentile |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C0 of a rate-up 5\* character | 80  | 158 | 161 |
| C6 of a rate-up 5\* character | 654 | 843 | 917 |
| C0 of a rate-up 4\* character | 26  | 93  | 141 |
| C6 of a rate-up 4\* character | 231 | 384 | 464 |

## Featured Weapon Banner

Before 63 Pulls \(Soft Pity\), the following chart details the probabilities of obtaining units/characters

| Item | Probability | Pity Guarantee |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5\* | 0.7% | 80 pulls |
| 4\* | 6% | 10 pulls |
| 3\* | 93.3% | N/A |

After the soft pity, the probability of the 5\* increases  by the base rate \* 10, making it significantly more probable to receive a 5\*.

The featured characters also have increased rates of pulling. The next 5\* is guaranteed to be a featured weapon if you roll a 5\* that is not featured. Similarly, for the 4\* weapons, a featured 4\* is guaranteed if a 4\* is rolled that is not featured. This guarantee will carry over across banner changes. With Epitomized Path, a selected specific featured 5\* weapon is guaranteed only on the 3rd 5\* pull following 2 other 5\* pulls which were not the selected 5\* weapon. Epitomized Path progress does **not** carry over across banner changes (resetting every 3 weeks).

Thus, the rates before pity weighting are as follows:

| Item | Probability |
| :--- | :--- |
| Featured 5\* | 0.525% |
| Arbitrary 5\* | 0.175% |
| Featured 4\* | 4.5% |
| Arbitrary 4\* | 1.5% |
| Arbitrary 3\* | 94.3% |
| Specific 3\* | 7.17% |

Estimated number of 5\* pulls to get desired weapon, with and without Epitomized Path or featured weapon pity (from a previous not-featured pull):

| Item | Pulls |
| :--- | :--- |
| **With Eptomized Path:** | |
| R1 weapon \(no pity\) | 1.984375 |
| R1 weapon \(with pity\) | 1.8125 |
| R5 weapon \(no pity\) | 9.921875 |
| R5 weapon \(with pity\) | 9.75 |
| **Without Epitomized Path:** | |
| R1 weapon \(no pity\) | 2.5 |
| R1 weapon \(with pity\) | 2.25 |
| R5 weapon \(no pity\) | 12.5 |
| R5 weapon \(with pity\) | 12.25 |

Number of pulls needed to get different results seperated by the 50th, 95th and 99th Precentile:  

| Item | 50th Percentile | 95th Percentile | 99th Percentile |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| R1 of a rate-up 5\* weapon    | 99  | 199 | 204 |
| R5 of a rate-up 5\* weapon    | 527 | 731 | 811 |

## Standard Banner

Before 74 Pulls \(Soft Pity\), the following chart details the probabilities of obtaining units/characters

| Item | Probability | Pity Guarantee |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5\* | 0.6% | 90 pulls |
| 4\* | 5.1% | 10 pulls |
| 3\* | 94.3% | N/A |

After the soft pity, the probability of the 5\* increases by  by the base rate \* 10, making it significantly more probable to receive a 5\*.

The rates before pity weighting are as follows:

| Item | Probability |
| :--- | :--- |
| Specific 5\* | 0.04% |
| Specific 4\* | 0.15% |
| Specific 3\* | 7.17% |

There are additional wish mechanics within the Standard Banner that complicate these probabilities. The Standard Banner has an underlying mechanic that ensures players do not roll weapons and characters multiple times consecutively. For 4\* characters and weapons, you must receive atleast one of each within 30 wishes. For 5\* characters and weapons, you must receive at least one of each within 270 wishes.
